\section{Conclusions}
Flavour physics has many faces. This is apparent already in the Standard Model (SM), where the origin of the flavour structure are the Higgs Yukawa couplings, but which exhibits itself in the flavour non-diagonal couplings of $W$, once we rotate to the quark mass eigenbasis. As a result we can search for signs of New Physics (NP) using flavour probes in many sectors: the Higgs couplings to the SM fermions, be it deviations in the flavour diagonal Yukawa couplings or in searches for flavour violating couplings, or in the flavour changing transitions of top quark, $b$ quark, charm quark, strange quark or leptons. HL-LHC and HE-LHC experiments are set to make great stride in almost all of these probes, as exhibited in great detail in this document. The high luminosity programs at ATLAS and CMS are unmatched in their ability to push the precision frontier  in measuring Higgs couplings and searching for rare top decays. LHCb with its planned \upgradetwo can, quite impressively, cover a very wide range of probes in $B$ physics, $D$ physics and kaon physics. This measurements will not be made in vacuum -- the upgraded Belle 2 super $B$ factory is coming on line at this very moment and is set to become a serious competitor, especially in the areas of $B$ and $D$ physics. However, there is also large complementarity between the two programs: LHCb (and ATLAS and CMS) works in a hadronic environment, and has access to larger set of hadronic states, such as heavy baryons, and a larger sample of $B_s$ mesons. LHCb \upgradetwo will thus allow the LHC to push well past the benchmarks set by Belle 2 in the near future. 
%, while Belle 2 is likely to be the frontrunner in the measurements with missing energy. 

It is important to note that the projected advancements in experiments are set to be accompanied by improvements in theory, most notably, in the calculations of the hadronic matrix elements by lattice QCD simulations. These matrix elements are required for the precision flavour measurements to be converted to constraints or discoveries of NP from its indirect imprint through virtual corrections. The combined improvements in the theoretical predictions, along with LHCb \upgradetwo are, for instance set to improve the current reach on the NP physics mass scale by more than a factor of two. This represents quite an impressive advance, with real discovery potential.
