\section{The high $p_T$ flavour physics program} 
%(anticipated length 15-20 pages)
\label{sec:highpT}

Flavour and high $p_T$ searches are intertwined in several ways. On the one hand the stringent bounds from low-energy constraints put severe bounds on the NP models that contain states with TeV masses with couplings to quarks.  On the other hand, TeV scale New Physics is suggested by several solutions of long standing problems of the SM, e.g., the hierarchy problem. Quite often the low energy constraints are avoided by assuming Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), where the only flavour breaking, even in the NP sector, is due to the SM Yukawa matrices. However, more general flavour structures for the NP states are still allowed. In fact such non-MFV couplings can have interesting consequences. In general we can group the NP models into two broad classes: \textit{(i)} models that address outstanding problems of the SM, such at the SM flavour puzzle, the origin of dark matter, or the hierarchy problem, which may have non trivial flavour structure,  and \textit{(ii)} models designed to explain the $b\to s\ell\ell$ and $b\to c\tau \nu$ flavour anomalies, that almost inevitably have quite a distinct flavour structure.  The NP mediators potentially responsible for the anomalies, $Z'$, $W'$ or leptoquarks, could be found at high $p_T$ searches in the HL- or HE-LHC.

%\td{need to write a general introduction} Flavour and high $p_T$ searches are intertwined in several ways. On the one hand the stringent bounds from low energy constraints put severe bounds on the NP models that contain states with TeV masses with couplings to quarks. Quite often these bounds are avoided by assuming Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), where the only flavour breaking, even in the NP sector, is due to the SM Yukawa matrices. However, more general flavour structures for the NP states are still allowed. In fact such non-MFV couplings can have interesting consequences. In general we can group the NP models into two broad classes: (i) NP models that aim to explain the SM flavour puzzle, and (ii) models that solve one of the outstanding problems particles physics, e.g., the origin of dark matter, or the hierarchy problem, but with nontrivial flavour structure in NP sector that leads to modified high $p_T$ searches. Such a nontrivial flavour structure is especially motivated in the models of NP that aim to explain the recent anomalies. 
%(not too many of these have states at TeV, though)

In the rest of this Section we first briefly review the models that address the SM flavour puzzle and have states that could be probed at the HL-/HE-LHC, and their implications for high $p_T$ searches. The second part of this Section is devoted to  high $p_T$ implications of $B$ physics anomalies.

%One of the most interesting models of New Physics

%This notion has great appeal as it can lead to a simultaneous resolution

problem~\cite{Grossman:1999ra,Gherghetta:2000qt}.
 %problem of the SM
%by accomodating rather naturally
%the observed large disparity 
%of fermion masses
%For lack of space we do not discuss the implications of 
%universal extra dimensions, for which we refer the reader 
%to the recent review by \cite{Hooper:2007qk}. 
In the Randall-Sundrum (RS) models the 5-dimensional space-time has 
anti-de Sitter geometry (AdS$_5$), truncated by flat 4D boundaries, 
the Planck (UV) and the TeV (IR) branes.  
This setup gives a warped metric in the bulk~\cite{Randall:1999ee}  
%\begin{equation}
$ds^2 = \exp(-2 k r_c |\phi| ) \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu - r_c^2 d\phi^2$,
%\label{metric}
%\end{equation}
where $k$ is the 5D curvature scale, $r_c$ the radius of compactification and  
$\phi\in [-\pi,\pi]$ the coordinate along the $5$-th dimension. 
The warp factor, $\exp({-2 k r_c |\phi|})$, leads to different length scales 
in different 4D slices along the $\phi$ direction, 
which provides a solution to the hierarchy problem.  
In particular, the Higgs field is assumed to be localized
near the TeV-brane so that the metric ``warps'' 
$\langle{H}\rangle_5 \sim M_5\sim M_P \sim 10^{19}$~GeV down to the weak scale, 
$\langle{H}\rangle_4 = \exp({-kr_c \pi}) \langle{H}\rangle_5$.  
For $kr_c \approx 12$ then $\langle{H}\rangle_{\rm SM} \equiv \langle{H}\rangle_4 \sim 1$~TeV.  

%Originally all the remaining SM fields were 
%assumed to also reside at the IR-brane~\cite{Davoudiasl:1999jd}.  
%However, the cutoff of the effective 4D theory is then also 
%red-shifted to the weak scale. 
%This in turn leads to unsuppressed higher dimensional operators 
%and thus large violations of the electroweak precision data and unacceptably 
%large FCNCs. 



The hierarchies among the quark masses can be realized by localizing the Higgs on the IR brane, while the fermions have different profiles in the $5$-th dimension. 
% problem can be solved by realizing that the points along the warped 
%$5^{\rm th}$ dimension correspond to different effective 4D cut-off scales. 
The first and second generation zero mode fermions are localized
close to the UV-brane and have small overlaps with the Higgs, giving small effective 4D SM Yukawa interactions, and thus small quark masses after electroweak symmetry breaking.
%the higher dimensional operators get suppressed 
%by effectively larger scales \cite{Gherghetta:2000qt}. 
%Note that this explains why first and second generation fermions are light: 
%the Yukawa interactions are small because of small overlap between
%IR localized Higgs and UV localized light fermion zero modes. 
The top quark, on the other hand, is localized near the TeV brane 
resulting in a large top Yukawa coupling. 


This configuration has a built in automatic suppression of FCNCs, which are suppressed by the 
same zero mode overlaps that gives the hierarchy of masses~\cite{Grossman:1999ra,Gherghetta:2000qt}. This is the RS analog of the SM Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism, dubbed RS-GIM in  \cite{Agashe:2004cp,Agashe:2004ay}.
%
% substantially (however, see below) 
%and reproduces the fermion mass hierarchies 
%without invoking large disparities in the Yukawa couplings of the fundamental
%5D action. 
%It thus has a built-in analog of the SM Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism 
%(the RS GIM), and reproduces the approximate flavor symmetry among the light fermions.
Similarly to the SM GIM, the RS GIM is violated by the large top quark mass. 
In particular, $(t,b)_L$ needs to be localized near the TeV brane, 
otherwise the 5D Yukawa coupling becomes too large and makes the theory
strongly coupled at the scale of the first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation. In general this 
leads to sizeable corrections to electroweak precision observables, such as the $Z b_L b_L$ couplings. 
Such problems can be largely ameliorated by enlarging the bulk symmetry such that it contains a custodial $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry \cite{Agashe:2003zs}, which for instance lowers the KK scale bounds from EW precision tests from 5 TeV to about 2TeV \cite{Agashe:2013kxa}. The consequences for flavour phenomenology have been worked out in a series of papers, see, e.g., \cite{Blanke:2008yr,Albrecht:2009xr,Casagrande:2010si,Casagrande:2008hr}, with $K-\bar K$ mixing for instance requiring the KK scale to be above 8 TeV \cite{Agashe:2013kxa}. With flavour alignment the scale of KK modes could be substantially lowered \cite{Csaki:2009wc} and could be reachable by HL/HE-LHC.

The KK gluon resonances cannot be produced from gluons \cite{Allanach:2009vz}, so that the LHC production is restricted to the quark-antiquark fusion, even though this is suppressed by the flavor dependent zero mode overlaps. This means that the LHC cross section for the first KK gluon resonances are small, suppressed also by the quark-anti-quark parton density functions (PDFs). The dominant decay mode is into $t\bar t$ final state, due to the large zero mode overlaps \cite{Agashe:2006hk}. Using the benchmark RS model from \cite{Lillie:2007yh}, the most recent CMS analysis for $t\bar t$ resonance searches, using both hadronic and leptonic tops, sets a bound of 4.55 TeV on the mass of the KK gluon  \cite{Sirunyan:2018ryr}. The projected reach for 33TeV and 100TeV $pp$ colliders can be found in \cite{Agashe:2013kxa}.

%mostly decay to top quarks because of the large overlaps 
%
%At leading order, a single KK gluon resonance cannot be produced from gluon initial states. The production at the
%        s = 14 TeV. The couplings of a KK gluon to quarks is also flavor-dependent and can be described by the same wavefunction overlap integrals
%LHC is therefore suppressed by the quark-anti-quark parton density functions (PDFs) at
%which appear in equation
%
%
%This has two consequences:
%(1) in the interaction basis, the coupling of $b_L$ to gauge KK modes
%(say the gluons),
%$g_{ G^{ \rm KK } }^b$, is
%large compared to the couplings of the lighter quarks.
%This is a source of flavor violation 
%leading to FCNCs. 
%(2) The Higgs vev mixes the zero mode of $Z$ and its KK modes, 
%leading to a non-universal shift 
%$\delta g_Z^{ b}  \sim  g_{Z^{\rm KK }}^{b}
%\sqrt{ \log \left( M_{\rm Pl} / \hbox{TeV} \right) }
%{ m_Z^2 }/{ m_{\rm KK }^2 }$
%in the coupling of
%$b_L$ to the physical $Z$~\cite{Agashe:2003zs,Burdman:2003ya}. Here $g_{Z^{\rm KK }}^{b}$ is the  
%coupling
%between $b_L$ and a KK $Z$ state before electroweak symmetry breaking.
%The factor $\sqrt{ \log \left( M_{\rm Pl} / \hbox{TeV} \right) }$ comes from
%enhanced Higgs coupling to gauge KK modes, 
%which are also localized near the TeV brane.
%Electroweak precision measurements of $Z\to b_L\bar b_L$ require that
%this shift is smaller than $\sim 1 \%$.
%Using $g^b_{Z^{\rm KK} } \sim g_Z$ this is satisfied for $m_{ KK } \sim 3 \ \hbox{TeV}$. 
%In passing we also note that with enhanced bulk electroweak gauge symmetry, 
%$SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$, and KK masses of $\approx$ 3 TeV,
%consistency with constraints from electroweak precision measurements 
%are achieved~\cite{Agashe:2003zs}.  
%
%The tension between obtaining a large top Yukawa coupling 
%and not introducing too large flavor violation and disagreement with EWP data~\cite{Agashe:2003zs,Burdman:2003ya} 
%is solved in all models by assuming
%(1) a close to maximal 5D Yukawa coupling, $\lambda_{\rm 5D} \sim 4$, 
%so that the weakly coupled effective theory contains $3$--$4$ KK modes, 
%and (2) by localizing $(t,b)_L$ as close
%to the TeV brane as allowed by  $\delta g_Z^{ b}\sim 1 \%$. 
%This almost unavoidable setup leads to sizeable NP contributions 
%in the following three types of FCNC processes that are top quark dominated:
%(i) $\Delta F = 2$ transitions, 
%(ii) $\Delta F = 1$ decays governed by box and EW penguin diagrams; 
%(iii) radiative decays. 
%
%Sizeable modifications of $\Delta F=2$ processes are possible 
%from tree-level KK gluon exchanges.
%The $\Delta F=1$ processes receive contributions from 
%tree level exchange of KK $Z$ modes. 
%These tend to give smaller effects than KK gluon exchanges. 
%Nevertheless it can lead to appreciable effects in the branching ratio,
%direct CP asymmetry and the spectrum of $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$~\cite{Burdman:2003ya,Agashe:2004ay,Agashe:2004cp}. 
%In $b \rightarrow s \bar{q} q$ QCD penguin dominated 
%$B\to (\phi, \eta^\prime, \pi^0, \omega, \rho^0) K_s$ decays 
%on the other hand the RS contributions from flavor-violating $Z$ vertex
%are at least $\sim g_Z^2 / g_s^2 \sim 20 \%$ suppressed and thus
%subleading~\cite{Agashe:2004ay,Agashe:2004cp}. 
%Consequently, RS models can accommodate only mild deviations
%from the SM in the corresponding time dependent CP asymmetries.
%
%We should emphasise that these models are not fully developed yet so 
%there can be appreciable uncertainties in the specific predictions. 
%For instance, the particular framework outlined above runs into at least 
%two problems unless the relevant KK-masses are much larger than $~3$ TeV:
%(i) the presence of right-handed couplings can cause enhanced contributions 
%to $\Delta S=2$ processes, $K$--$\bar K$ mixing and $\epsilon_K$~\cite{Beall:1981ze,Bona:2007vi}, 
%and (ii) the simple framework with ${\cal O}(1)$ complex phases tends to give 
%an electron electric dipole moment about a factor $\sim 20$ above the 
%experimental bound~\cite{Agashe:2004ay,Agashe:2004cp}. 
%An interesting proposal for the flavor dynamics in the
%RS setup was recently put forward by~\cite{Fitzpatrick:2007sa} who
%introduced 5D anarchic minimal flavor violation in the quark sector 
%(see also ~\cite{Cacciapaglia:2007fw}). 
%This gives a low energy effective theory that falls in the NMFV class, 
%consistent with both FCNC and dipole moment constraints 
%(see section~\ref{Sec:MFV}).
%In this picture new flavor and CP violation phases are present, 
%however, their dominant effect occurs only in the up type quark sector.  

\subsubsection{Partial compositeness}
Partial compositeness as the origin of the flavour hierarchies in composite Higgs models \cite{Kaplan:1991dc} is the holographic dual to the RS models of flavour. While the Higgs is the lightest state of the composite sector, usually a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson from global symmetry breaking, the SM fermions and gauge bosons are elementary (for a review, see, e.g, \cite{Panico:2015jxa}). The elementary fermions, $Q,U,D$, are coupled to the composite sector through linear mixing with the composite operators, ${\mathcal O}_Q$, ${\mathcal O}_U$, ${\mathcal O}_D$,
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}\supset \epsilon_Q \bar Q_L {\mathcal O}_Q +\epsilon_U \bar U_R{\mathcal O}_U+\epsilon_D \bar D_R {\mathcal O}_D.
\end{equation}
The mixing parameters $\epsilon_a$ exhibit exponentially large hierarchies because of large, yet still ${\mathcal O}(1)$, differences in anomalous dimensions of the corresponding composite operators. This is the analog of the zero mode overlaps in the RS models. The SM Yukawa are given by $(Y_{U(D)})_{ij}\sim \epsilon_{Q}^i \epsilon_{U(D)}^j$. For 
$\epsilon_Q^1\ll \epsilon_Q^2\ll \epsilon_Q^3\sim 1$, $\epsilon_U^1\ll \epsilon_U^2\ll \epsilon_U^3\sim 1$, $\epsilon_D^1\ll \epsilon_D^2\ll \epsilon_D^3\ll 1$ one can obtain the SM structure of quark masses and CKM mixings. 

The composite Higgs models are described by the compositeness scale $f$ and the mass of the first composite resonances, $M_*\sim g_* f$, with $g_*$ the typical strength of the resonances in the composite sector. The searches at the HL-/HE-LHC consist of Higgs coupling measurements, including deviations in Higgs Yukawa couplings (for further details see the discussion in the WG2 write-up \td{cite}),
%\td{cite WG2}, 
and searches for composite resonances preferably coupled to third generation fermions, electroweak gauge bosons, or the Higgs (further details can be found in WG3 write-up \td{cite}). Flavour observables put strong bounds on $M_*$, if the flavour structure is assumed to be generic. Such bounds can be relaxed in the case of approximate flavour symmetries, see, e.g., Ref. \cite{Panico:2015jxa} for a review.

\subsubsection{Low scale gauge flavour  symmetries}
The SM has in the limit of vanishing Yukawa couplings a large global symmetry. In the quark sector this is $G_F=SU(3)_Q\times SU(3)_U\times SU(3)_D$. Ref. \cite{Grinstein:2010ve} showed that the SM flavor symmetry group $G_F$ is anomaly free, if one adds a set of fermions that are vector-like under the SM gauged group, but chiral under the $G_F$. This means that $G_F$ can be gauged. It is broken by a set of scalar fields that have hiearchical vevs and lead to hierarchy of SM quark masses. This also implies a hierarchy  for the masses of the flavoured gauge bosons, with gauge bosons that more strongly couple to third generation being lighter, while the flavoured gauge bosons that couple more strongly to the first two generations are significantly heavier. This pattern in the spectrum of flavoured gauge bosons then avoids too large contributions to FCNCs \cite{Buras:2011wi}.  
%\td{to be done}

At the LHC one searches for the lightest flavoured gauge bosons, with ${\mathcal O}({\rm TeV})$ masses, which couple mostly to $b$ quarks and $t$ quarks, but could also have non-negligible couplings to the first two generations. The di-jet and $t\bar t$ resonance searches are thus sensitive probes. A signal could also come from production of the lightest vectorlike fermions, $t'$, or $b'$ \cite{Grinstein:2010ve}. For several further benchmarks see, e.g., Ref. \cite{Bishara:2015mha}, where also a connection with dark matter was explored.

\subsubsection{2HDM and low scale flavour models}
\label{sec:2HDM:flavour}
%taken from WG2, should cite them
{\it\small Author(s) (TH): Martin Bauer, Marcela Carena and Adri\'an Carmona.}\\
In 2 Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs), the two Higgs doublets, $H_1$ and $H_2$ are usually assumed not to carry flavour quantum numbers. The collider phenomenology, on the other hand, changes substantially, if they do. 
% the term $H_1 H_2\equiv H_1^T (i\sigma_2) H_2 $ is a SM singlet which can however be charged under an additional $U(1)$ flavour symmetry. 
 This is an interesting possibility that could solve the SM flavour puzzle via the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism where the flavon is replaced by the $H_1 H_2\equiv H_1^T (i\sigma_2) H_2$ operator. In this way, the NP scale $\Lambda$ where the higher dimensional FN operators are generated is tied to the electroweak scale, leading to much stronger phenomenological consequences. Let us assume for concreteness a type-I like 2DHM with the following Yukawa Lagrangian in the quark sector \cite{Bauer:2015kzy,Bauer:2015fxa}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:yuk1}
\mathcal{L}_Y\supset  y^u_{ij} \left(\frac{H_1 H_2}{\Lambda^2}\right)^{n_{u_{ij}}}\bar{q}_L^{i}H_1 u_{R}^j+y^d_{ij} \left(\frac{H_1^{\dagger} H_2^{\dagger}}{\Lambda^2}\right)^{n_{d_{ij}}}\bar{q}_L^{i}\tilde{H}_1 d_{R}^j
%+y_{ij}^{\ell}\left(\frac{H_1^{\dagger}H_2^{\dagger}}{\Lambda^2}\right)^{n_{e_{ij}}}\bar{\ell}_{L}^i\tilde{H}_1 e_R^j
+\mathrm{h.c.}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{H}_1\equiv i\sigma_2 H^{\ast}_1$ as usual, and the charges $n_{u,d,e}$ are a combination of the $U(1)$ charges of $H_1$, $(H_1H_2)$ and the different SM fermion fields (for an alternative discussion, where $H_1, H_2$ carry flavour charges, but the Yukawa interactions are taken to be renormalizable, see \cite{Dery:2016fyj}). For simplicity, we set the flavour charges of $H_1$ and $H_2$ to $0$ and $1$, respectively, such that  
%\begin{align}
$n_{u_{ij}}=a_{q_i}-a_{u_j}, n_{d_{ij}}=-a_{q_i}+a_{d_j}$,
%\end{align}
if we denote by $a_{q_i},a_{u_i}, \ldots,$ the $U(1)$ charges of the SM fermions. In general, the fermion masses are given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:epsilon}
m_\psi=y_{\psi} \varepsilon^{n_\psi} \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}},  \qquad \varepsilon = \frac{v_1 v_2}{2\Lambda^2}=\frac{t_\beta}{1+t_\beta^2}\frac{v^2}{2\Lambda^2},
\end{equation}
with the vacuum expectation values $\langle H_{1, 2}\rangle=v_{1, 2}$ and $t_\beta \equiv v_1/v_2$. For the right assignment of flavour charges one is able to accommodate the observed hierarchy of SM fermion masses and mixing angles.  This framework also leads to enhanced diagonal Yukawa couplings between the Higgs and the SM fermions, while FCNCs are suppressed. If we denote by $h$ and $H$ the two neutral scalar mass eigenstates, with $h$ the observed $125$ GeV Higgs, the couplings between the scalars $\varphi=h,H$ and SM fermions $\psi_{L_i, R_i}= P_{L,R} \psi_i$ in the mass eigenbasis read 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:newlagrangian}
\mathcal{L}= g_{\varphi \psi_{L_i} \psi_{R_j} }\, \varphi \,\bar \psi_{L_i} \psi_{R_j}+\mathrm{h.c.}
\end{equation}
with $i$, such that $u_i=u, c,t$,\,  $d_i=d,s,b$ and $e_i=e,\mu,\tau$. This induces 
flavour-diagonal couplings 
\begin{align}\label{eq:diagocoup}
g_{\varphi \psi_{L_i}\psi_{R_i}}= \kappa^\varphi_{\psi_i}\, \frac{m_{\psi_i}}{v} =\left(g^{\varphi}_{\psi_i}(\alpha,\beta)+n_{\psi_i}\, f^\varphi(\alpha, \beta)\right)\frac{m_{\psi_i}}{v},
\end{align}
as well as flavour off-diagonal couplings
 \begin{align}\label{eq:foffc}
g_{\varphi \psi_{L_i}\psi_{R_j}}&=  f^\varphi(\alpha, \beta)\left(\mathcal{A}_{ij}\frac{m_{\psi_j}}{v}-\frac{m_{\psi_i}}{v}\mathcal{B}_{ij} \right)\,.
\end{align}
The flavour universal functions in \eqref{eq:diagocoup} and \eqref{eq:foffc} are
$g^h_{\psi_i}={c_{\beta-\alpha}}/{t_\beta}+s_{\beta-\alpha}$, $ g^H_{\psi_i}=c_{\beta-\alpha}-{s_{\beta-\alpha}}/{t_\beta}$,
and
$ f^h(\alpha,\beta)=c_{\beta-\alpha}\big({1}/{t_\beta}-t_\beta\big)+2s_{\beta-\alpha}$, $f^H(\alpha,\beta)=-s_{\beta-\alpha}\big({1}/{t_\beta}-t_\beta\big)+2c_{\beta-\alpha}$,
where $c_{x}\equiv \cos x$, $s_x\equiv \sin x$. The entries in matrices $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are proportional to the flavour charges of the corresponding fermions that define the coefficients in \eqref{eq:yuk1}. Unless all flavour charges for a given type of fermions are equal, the off-diagonal elements in matrices $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ lead to FCNCs which are chirally suppressed by powers of the ratio~$\varepsilon$, see \cite{Bauer:2017cov} for more details and explicit examples for scalings of matrix elements in $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$.


\subsubsection{\bf A Clockwork solution to the flavour puzzle}
%\td{need to shorten}
{\it\small Author(s) (TH): Adri\'an Carmona.}\\
The clockwork mechanism, introduced in \cite{Choi:2015fiu, Kaplan:2015fuy} and later generalized to a broader context in Ref.~\cite{Giudice:2016yja}, allows one to obtain large hierarchies in couplings or mass scales. Ref. \cite{Alonso:2018bcg} showed that it can also be used to generate the observed hierarchy of quark masses and mixing angles with anarchic Yukawa couplings, providing a solution to the flavour puzzle. 

In the clockwork solution to the flavour puzzle, each SM chiral fermion $\psi$ is accompanied with a $N_\psi$-node chain of vector-like fermions, $\psi_{L,j},\psi_{R,j}$, with masses $m$, and
%In the simple case of clockworking just a right-handed chiral field $\psi_R\equiv \psi_{R,0}$, one adds a $N$-node chain of vector like fermions $\psi_{L,j},\psi_{R,j}$, with masses $m\bar{\psi}_{L,j}\psi_{R,j}$, as well as 
a series of nearest neighbour mass terms, $qm\bar{\psi}_{L,j}\psi_{R,j-1}$, between the nodes, where  $j=1,\ldots,N_\psi$. The mass spectrum of each chain has one chiral zero mode, the would-be SM fermion, 
%chains of fermions $\psi_{R,j}$ and $\psi_{L,j}$  carry the same gauge quantum numbers as $\psi_{R,0}$. The covariant derivatives are thus the same for fermions on all the nodes. After diagonalization, one obtains a chiral massless state, $\psi_{R,0}^{\prime}$, 
and $N_\psi$  heavy Dirac fermion mass-eigenstates -- the gears.
%, with masses $M_{k}^2=m^2(1+q^2-2q\cos(\frac{k\pi}{N_\psi+1}))$.
For $q\gg 1$,  the spectrum of the gears is compressed in a $2m$ band around $qm$, with $(M_{N_\psi}-M_1)\ll M_1$. The massless zero-mode interacts with the SM Higgs, which is on the $0$-th node, through a set of Yukawa interactions described by ${\mathcal O}(1)$ Yukawa matrices, $Y_{U,D}$. 
The component of the massless mode on the $0$-th node is, 
%$\psi_{R,0}^{\prime}$ has a component $f_{\psi}$ on the $0$-th node which, 
in the large $q$ limit, given by $1/q^{N_\psi}$. This suppression is the origin of the SM Yukawa hierarchies, 
%\td{check Higgs section notation}
%In order to explain the hierarchy of SM quark masses through the clockworking mechanism we introduce for each of the SM fermions, $\psi_i$, where $i=1,2,3$, is the generation index, an $N_{\psi_i}$-node chain of 
%vector-like fermions with the same quantum numbers. In addition, the SM Higgs resides on the $0$-th node, coupling the fermions on the $0$-th nde through Yukawa interactions.  After electroweak symmetry breaking the Yukawa interactions lead to a mass term for the zero modes, which  are identified with the SM fermions. To leading order in $v^2/M^2$ expansion, the SM Higgs Yukawa matrices are given by the products of zero mode overlaps with the $0$-th node, $f_\psi$,
\begin{align}
\label{eqa:YuSM}
\left(Y_u^{\rm SM}\right)_{ij}&\sim q^{-N_{Q(i)}}_{Q(i)}\left(Y_U\right)_{ij}q^{-N_{u(j)}}_{u(j)},  \quad \left(Y_d^{\rm SM}\right)_{ij} \sim q^{-N_{Q(i)}}_{Q(i)}\left(Y_D\right)_{ij}q^{-N_{d(j)}}_{d(j)}.
\end{align}
The hierarchy of quark masses can be then naturally obtained for anarchical $Y_U$ and $Y_D$ Yukawa matrices if $q^{-N_{Q(i)}}\ll q^{-N_{Q(j)}}$, $q^{-N_{u(i)}}_{u(i)}\ll q^{-N_{u(j)}}_{u(j)}$, $q^{-N_{d(i)}}_{d(i)}\ll q^{-N_{d(j)}}_{d(j)}$, for $i<j$ (in the benchmark below we take $q_i$ to be universal and equal to $q$).
% For the sake of concreteness,  we will only consider the clockwork universal-$q$ limit, which occurs  when all the clockwork factors are the same, $q\equiv q_{Q(i)}=q_{u(i)}=q_{d(i)}\sim {\mathcal O}({\rm few})$, while $N_{Q(1)}\gg N_{Q(2)} \gg N_{Q(3)}$   and similarly for up and down right-handed quarks.\footnote{In particular, we consider  $q=1/\lambda$, with $\lambda=|V_{us}|\simeq0.23$ as well as $N_{Q(1)}=3, N_{Q(2)}=2$, $N_{u(1)}=4$, $N_{u(2)}=1$, $N_{d(1)}=4$, $N_{d(2)}=3$, $N_{d(3)}=2$ and $N_{Q(3)}=N_{u(3)}=0$.} The large multiplicity of colored fermionic degrees of freedom  destroys asymptotic freedom for the strong interaction, putting an upper bound on the maximum number of  gears.  On the other hand, quark loops will also provide a negative contribution to the one-loop beta function of the Higgs quartic self-coupling $\lambda |H|^4/2$. Requiring that the beta function remains perturbative constraints the Yukawa entries in $Y_U$ and $Y_D$ to be smaller than 1,  with the possible exception of $\left(Y_U\right)_{33}$.

%Clockworking  a  left-handed chiral fermion, $\psi_L$, proceeds along exactly the same lines, but exchanging  $L\leftrightarrow R$ everywhere. 

%Unlike the zero mode, the profiles of the gears are not exponentially suppressed on the $0$-th node, even when $q,N\gg 1$.

%If one integrates out all the new heavy particles, one can use the generated dimension-6 operators of the SM effective field theory  to analyze the constraints from low-energy experiments: from weak boson decays, rare meson decays and neutral meson mixings. 
The clockwork models of flavour are endowed with a powerful flavour protection against FCNCs, very similar to the RS models.  The FCNCs with light quarks on the external legs are suppressed by the same small overlaps of the zero-modes, giving rise to hierarchies between the SM quark masses. This clockwork-GIM  mechanism, along with the constraints on $Y_{U,D}$ arising from the stability of the Higgs potential,   suffices to alleviate the flavour constraints to the level that TeV scale gear masses are compatible with experimental bounds~\cite{Alonso:2018bcg}.

% and at future high energy colliders. 
%The main production channel for the gears is the QCD pair production with the corresponding cross sections precisely calculable~\cite{Czakon:2017wor}. 
The collider signatures
%, on the other hand, do 
depend on the gear decay patterns. The gears decay predominantly through their coupling to the Higgs doublet into gears from a different-chirality chain.
The lightest gears decay directly to SM fermions, mostly $t$ and $b$, via the emission of $W,Z$ or $h$, as do heavier gears for which these are the only kinematically allowed channels. 
%Given the overlap suppression the decays are predominantly to $t$ and $b$. 
The main existing collider constraints

%, both using 35 fb${}^{-1}$ of LHC data at 13~TeV for the two benchmarks defined in Ref.~\cite{Alonso:2018bcg}. The results for the last of these benchmarks are shown in the left panel of 
Fig.~\ref{fig:both}.





The dense spectrum of gears and the potentially complex pattern of gear decays poses an experimental challenge.
% also in the case a signal is discovered. 
In the conventional vector-like quark searches the clockwork signal will appear as an excess of events with high transverse energies or $H_T$, but without a dominant single peak in the invariant mass of any particular final state, such as $tH$ or $tW$. Ref.~\cite{Alonso:2018bcg} proposed a novel reconstruction strategy targeting pair production of heavy quarks with a-priori unknown but potentially long decay chains that result in a single heavy flavoured quark, $t$ or $b$, plus any number of massive weak or Higgs bosons per decay chain. The proposed search strategy uses a modified hemisphere clustering algorithm, with $t-$ and $b-$tagged jets as seeds for clustering into exactly two pseudo-jets (the invariant mass of these is shown as mid-gray distribution in Fig.~\ref{fig:both} right). The original hemisphere clustering uses instead the jets with highest invariant mass as seeds and shows no sharp features (light gray). Requiring that the masses of the two pseudo-jets differ by less then 30\% gives the dark grey distribution, with clearly visible gears (in the exploratory study of~\cite{Alonso:2018bcg} tops, $b$-quarks, $W$, $Z$ and the Higgs were not decayed).

%Our procedure is based on the so-called hemisphere clustering algorithm, defined in Section 13.4 of Ref.~\cite{Ball:2007zza}. Jets, as well as isolated leptons and photons, are clustered into exactly two pseudojets, where the clustering is performed by minimizing the Lund distance measure~\cite{Sjostrand:1982am}. The original hemisphere algorithm is seeded by the two objects with the largest combined invariant mass. Since each gear decay chain results in exactly one heavy flavoured quark ($t$ or $b$) we instead seed our algorithm with $t$- and $b$-tagged jets. The idea is that, at least for the moderately boosted pair produced gears, the two pseudojets will predominatly capture the decay products of the individual gears. Finally, we select events, where the invariant masses of the two pseudojets are comparable. 
%
%We demonstrate the usefulness of our procedure by simulating gear production and decay for the benchmark model at parton level (where tops, $b$-quarks, $W$, $Z$ and the Higgs are not decayed). The results are shown in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:both}, where we plot the invariant mass distributions of individual pseudojets and overlay the spectral lines of the gears in the benchmark model. The resulting spectrum with the original hemisphere clustering does not exhibit any sharp features, with the bulk of the invariant mass distribution lying well below the mass of the lightest gear. The invariant mass distribution for the modified hemisphere algorithm already exhibits clear spectral line features. The pseudojets with masses of the top and $b$-quarks are abundantly identified, but also those of a few lowest lying gears. Finally, when one only keeps the events for which the masses of the two pseudojets differ by less than 30\%, the low invariant mass peaks corresponding to the pseudojets containing only a single top or $b$-quark  are rejected by this requirement. In addition, the gear peaks are even more pronounced after this cut, with little loss in the number of signal events in the peaks. 




\subsection{Flavour implications for high $p_T$ new physics searches}

%\td{a few sentences to tie over}
In this subsection we collect several signatures of flavour models or models where nontrivial flavour structure is relevant for high $p_T$ searches: the FCNC top decays to exotica, the (model dependent) implications for di-Higgs production, and the set of signatures that are related to neutrino mass models.

The FCNC mediated processes are rare within the SM. However, LHC is a top factory and significant number of events are expected even for top decays with very small branching ratios. In light of this, studies of top FCNC decays to SM particles have garnered a strong interest in the community~\cite{Agashe:2009di,Mele:1998ag,Greljo:2014dka,Azatov:2014lha,Khachatryan:2015att,Botella:2015hoa,Bardhan:2016txk,Badziak:2017wxn,Khachatryan:2016sib,Gabrielli:2016cut,CMS-PAS-TOP-17-017,Aaboud:2018nyl,Aaboud:2017mfd,Aaboud:2018pob,Papaefstathiou:2017xuv,Abbas:2015cua}. The FCNC top decays to SM particles, $t\to q Z, q \gamma, qg, q H$, $q=u,c$, and the related constraints from FCNC production processes, were discussed in Sections \ref{sec:top:FCNC} and \ref{sec:8:EXP:FCNC}.

%\td{need to say something more about classic $t\to c Z$, etc signals, i.e., reference to section \ref{sec:top:quark}, once that is finished}

In the presence of light NP, other exotic top FCNC decays are possible. We highlight one such possibility, where the NP spectrum contains a light 
%extend previous works by studying the top decay
%to a 
scalar singlet, $S$, with mass $m_S$ below the top quark mass.
%around the Electroweak (EW) scale and an up-type light quark.
Such scalar
particle is predicted in a number of well-motivated NP models, e.g., in the NMSSM~\cite{Ellwanger:2009dp} and in
non-minimal composite Higgs models~\cite{Dimopoulos:1981xc,Kaplan:1983fs,Kaplan:1983sm,Panico:2015jxa}. Moreover, quite often the induced $t\to cS, uS$ FCNC decays are easier to probe than, for instance the ones involving the SM Higgs, $t\to ch, uh$~\cite{Zhang:2013xya}. 
%such a scalar can usually induce FCNCs to a degree significantly larger than what can be mediated by an SM-like Higgs 
%boson
The reason is three-fold; \textit{(i)} The top FCNCs mediated by 
$S$ are usually suppressed by one less power of the heavy physics scale; \textit{(ii)} $S$ may have a larger decay width into cleaner final states, such as $\ell^+\ell^-$, $b\overline{b}$ 
or $\gamma\gamma$; \textit{(iii)} $S$ can be much lighter than the Higgs, reducing the 
%corresponding top decay
%being therefore 
phase space suppression. %Thus, top FCNCs mediated by new singlet scalars might be seen at the 
%future runs of the LHC.
Note that very light $S$, i.e., with $m_S < m_h/2\sim 62.5$ GeV, need not be
excluded by the LHC constraints on the Higgs width, $\Gamma(h\rightarrow S S) \lesssim 10$ MeV ~\cite{Khachatryan:2016ctc}. Indeed, 
for a quartic coupling $\lambda_{HS} S^2 |H|^2$, 
%we have
%$\Gamma(h\rightarrow S S)\sim \lambda_{HS}^2/(32\pi) \times v^2/m_h$, so we can evade the aforementioned 
this bound is avoided for $\lambda_{HS} < 0.05$.

There are no direct experimental limits on $t \to q S$ from colliders. The indirect constraints from 1-loop box diagrams in 
$D^0-\bar{D}^0$ oscillations constrain the products of two $S$ Yukawas, $\tilde Y_{ut} \tilde Y_{ct(tc)}$, and $\tilde Y_{tu} \tilde Y_{ct(tc)}$, to be small~\cite{Bona:2007vi,Harnik:2012pb,Agashe:2013hma}. The $S\bar t c$ or $S\bar t u$ couplings can still be sizeable, but not both at the same time. Inspired by the CMS $t\to hc$ search~\cite{CMS:2017cck}, Ref.~\cite{Banerjee:2018fsx} developed a dedicated analysis for $t\to qS$, by varying the mass of $S$, $m_S$. The projections at the 14 TeV LHC for  $S \to b\bar{b}$ and $S \to \gamma \gamma$ decays  are shown in Figs. \ref{fig:sbb2} .
%and \ref{fig:sgg2}, respectively.  
%However, one can have constraints from flavour 
%observables, \textit{viz.}, $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ oscillations~\cite{Bona:2007vi,Harnik:2012pb,Agashe:2013hma}. These
%constraints are always in the form of a product of two $S$ Yukawas, $Y_{ct}$ and $Y_{ut}$ (and also $Y_{uc}$). One 
%can always fall back upon scenarios where $Y_{ut}$ is negligibly small, rendering these constraints unimportant.
%%
%Therefore, inspired by the $t\to hc$ search by CMS~\cite{CMS:2017cck}, we develop dedicated analyses for $t\to qS$,
%by varying $m_S$.
%We first discuss the model-independent framework and then discuss the analyses and results in two different 
%final states, \textit{viz.}, $S \to b\bar{b}$ and $S \to \gamma \gamma$ at the 14 TeV LHC. Finally, we quote naive 
%estimations at $\sqrt{s} = 27$ TeV and $\sqrt{s} = 100$ TeV. \\ \\

%{\bf Effective Lagrangian} \\
Assuming that $S$ is the only light NP state, its couplings to the SM quarks are induced by dimension 5 effective operator (not displaying generational indices)

\end{equation}
where $f$ is the NP scale, and on the r.h.s. we introduced a new flavour violating coupling $\tilde g$. The three Benchmark Points (BP) shown in Figs. \ref{fig:sbb2}

\end{equation}
%
%We study a scenario where the SM Higgs sector is extended by a gauge singlet, $S$, with mass $m_S$. 
%At low energies, the relevant Yukawa Lagrangian can be written as~
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:lag}
% \mathcal{L} = -\mathbf{\overline{q_L}}\bigg(\mathbf{Y} + \mathbf{Y'}\frac{|H|^2}{f^2} + \mathbf{\tilde{Y}}\frac{S}{f}\bigg)  \tilde{H} \mathbf{u_R} + \text{h.c.}~,

%where $H = [\phi^+, (h + \phi^0)/\sqrt{2}]^t$, is the SM-like Higgs doublet, $\mathbf{q_L}$ ($\mathbf{u_R}$) denotes

%flavour matrices, $v\sim 246$ GeV, is the Higgs vacuum expectation value (\textit{vev}) and $f\gtrsim 
%\mathcal{O}(\textrm{TeV})$ is the new physics scale. Normally, the flavour matrices are not aligned, and hence the
%FCNCs can arise in the EW phase. This induces various new physics effects including the top flavour-violating decays, 
%\textit{viz.}, $t\rightarrow h c$ or $t\rightarrow S c$. As discussed before, the latter dominates. (In CHMs, Higgs mediated
%top FCNCs are even absent in first approximation~\cite{Agashe:2009di}, \textit{i.e.} $\mathbf{Y}\sim\mathbf{Y^\prime}$, whereas this does not need to be the case for $S$~\cite{Banerjee:2018fsx}).
%
%After the EWSB, one obtains
%%
%\begin{align}
%\label{lag:lag1}
% \mathcal{L} &= -\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}\bigg[\mathbf{\overline{q_L}}\mathbf{Y}\left(1+\frac{h}{v}\right)\mathbf{u_R} + \frac{S}{f}\mathbf{\overline{q_L}}\mathbf{\tilde{Y}}\mathbf{u_R} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{f^2}\right)\bigg]\supset \tilde{g} \frac{m_t}{f} \overline{t_L} S c_R + \text{h.c.},

 The suppression of $S\to \gamma\gamma$ can be partially 
compensated by scaling with $m_S$, so that $\mathcal{B}(S\to \gamma\gamma)$ can possibly be 
significantly larger than $\mathcal{B}(h\to \gamma\gamma)$. Searches should thus use both $S\to b\bar b$ and $S\to \gamma\gamma$. The details on how to reduce the backgrounds can be found in~\cite{Banerjee:2018fsx}.

that for the signal, and is $\sim 4(40)$. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $10$ ab$^{-1}$,

Interestingly, in some models the flavour structure can feed back into nontrivial constraints on the scalar potential. This was demonstrated in the 2HDM model with FN charges, introduced in Section \ref{sec:2HDM:flavour}.
The scalar couplings to gauge bosons are the same as in the normal type-I 2HDM while the scalar coupling between the heavy Higgs $H$ and two SM Higgs scalars $h$, as well as the triple Higgs coupling can be expressed as \cite{Boudjema:2001ii,Gunion:2002zf}

where $M_A$ is the pseudoscalar mass. The $U(1)$ flavour symmetry restricts the number of allowed terms in the scalar potential forbidding, e.g., terms proportional to $H_1 H_2$. Interestingly, one can rewrite such self scalar interactions with the help of function $f^h(\alpha,\beta)$, since it is related to the combination $H_1 H_2^{\dagger}$ appearing in both the scalar potential and the higher dimensional operators generating different Yukawa couplings. Therefore, the parameter space for which $f^h(\alpha,\beta)\gg 1$ and  $c_{\beta-\alpha}\neq 0$ leads to maximally enhanced diagonal couplings of the SM Higgs to fermions \eqref{eq:diagocoup} as well as to enhanced trilinear couplings \eqref{eq:mainn1} and \eqref{eq:mainn2}. For maximally enhanced Yukawa couplings, the mass of the heavy Higgs $H$ cannot be taken arbitrarily large and resonant Higgs pair production has to be present. This correlation between the enhancement of the Higgs Yukawa couplings $\kappa^h_{\psi}$ and $\text{Br}(H \to hh)$ is illustrated for $M_H=M_A=M_{H^\pm}=500$ GeV in Fig. \ref{fig:BRvskappa} (left) where we plot the dependence of $\text{Br}(H \to hh)$ on $c_{\beta-\alpha} $ and $ t_\beta$ \cite{Bauer:2017cov}.  The dashed contours correspond to constant values of $|\kappa_{\psi}^h|$ for $n_{\psi}=1$. The correlation does not depend on the factor $n_\psi$, although  $n_\psi > 1$ leads to a larger enhancement. The two exceptions for which this correlation breaks down are the limits $c_{\beta-\alpha}\approx 0$ (disfavored in the flavour model) and $c_{\beta-\alpha}\approx \pm 1$ (disfavoured by SM Higgs couplings strength measurements). Depending on the structure of the Yukawa couplings, the value of $\kappa^h_\psi$ in Figure~\ref{fig:BRvskappa} (left) can be larger or smaller than the value $n=1$ chosen to illustrate the relation between $g_{Hhh}$ and $\kappa^h_\psi$. Current experimental limits constrain this structure. For example, since $\kappa^h_\mu < 2.1$ \cite{ATLAS:2018kbw}, either $n=0$ for the muon, or one is constrained to the $\kappa^h_\mu < 2.1$ parameter space in Figure~\ref{fig:BRvskappa} (left). 
%, the first one (which corresponds to the decoupling limit) is at odds with the flavour model, for it requires large values of the spurion $\mu_3\propto M_A$ which softly breaks the $U(1)$ flavour symmetry.

%The enhancement in $\text{Br}(H\to hh)$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BRvskappa} is partially cancelled in the production cross section $\sigma(gg\to H)$ for large values of $t_{\beta}$ due to the fact that $\sigma(gg\to H)\propto 1+1/t_\beta^2-(\kappa_t^h)^2$, with $\kappa_t^h \approx 1$. However, the cross-section $\sigma(gg\to h\to hh)$ is not suppressed for such values of $t_{\beta}$ and the combination of both contributions leads to a continuous enhancement in the di-Higgs cross-section. 
There is  a non-trivial interplay between resonant and non-resonant contributions to $pp\to hh$, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:BRvskappa} (right), for $\sqrt{s}=27$ TeV, setting $M_A=450$ GeV and $M_{H}=M_{H^{\pm}}=550$ GeV,  $c_{\beta-\alpha}=-0.45$ and three different values of $\kappa_{\psi}^{h}=3, 4$ and $5$. When the enhancement in the Higgs Yukawa couplings is large enough, the interference between non-resonant and resonant contributions turns the broad peak into a shoulder in the $d\sigma/ dm_{hh}$ distribution for the total cross section, as shown for the case $\kappa_{\psi}^h=5$ by the blue line.
% Resolving such shape in the  invariant mass distribution can be quite challenging. We encourage a dedicated analysis considering the corresponding $d\sigma/dm_{hh}$ templates to maximize the sensitivity to features in the di-Higgs invariant mass distribution from the simultaneous enhancement of  $g_{hhh}$, $g_{Hhh}$ and $\kappa^h_{\psi}$.

%\pf{Some issues to be addressed: e.g. need to be consistent about HE lumi, plots with 100 TeV curves and no 27TeV curve need to be fixed}

The questions pertaining to neutrino masses: whether  or not  neutrinos are Majorana particles, the origin of smallness of the neutrino masses,  as well as the reason for  large mixing angles, remain some of the most pressing open issues in particle physics today.
A set of potential solutions is provided by the seesaw models. These postulate new particles that couple to SM fields via
mixing/Yukawa couplings, SM gauge currents, and/or new gauge symmetries.
If accessible, a plethora of rich physics can be studied in considerable detail at hadron colliders. 
This would complement low energy and oscillation probes of neutrinos~\cite{Atre:2009rg,Cai:2017mow}.
In the following, we summarize the discovery potential of seesaw models at hadron colliders with collision energies of $\sqrt{s} = 14$ and 27 TeV.
%In particular, we will discuss models featuring heavy neutrinos, both pseudo-Dirac and Majorana as well as those with new gauge interaction, and models featuring scalar and fermion electroweak triplets.
%In Sec.~\ref{sec:lhcSeesawtype1}, models featuring heavy neutrinos, both pseudo-Dirac and Majorana as well as those with new gauge interactions, are discussed.
%Similarly, in Sec.~\ref{sec:lhcSeesawtype2} and Sec.~\ref{sec:lhcSeesawtype3}, models featuring scalar and fermion electroweak triplets are assessed, respectively.
For a more comprehensive reviews on the sensitivity of colliders to neutrino mass models, see \cite{Atre:2009rg,Cai:2017mow,Weiland:2013wha,Ruiz:2015gsa,Marcano:2017ucg} and references therein.

\paragraph*{The Type I Seesaw and Variants}\label{sec:lhcSeesawtype1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In Type I seesaw the light neutrino masses and mixing are generated from couplings of SM leptons to new fermionic gauge singlets with Majorana masses. 
%In \cite{Kersten:2007vk,Moffat:2017feq}, it was proved that requiring all three light neutrinos to be massless is equivalent 
%to the conservation of lepton number at all orders in perturbation theory. 
%In other words, f
For low-scale seesaw models with only fermionic singlets, 
lepton number has to be nearly conserved and light neutrino masses are proportional to small lepton number violating (LNV) parameters~\cite{Kersten:2007vk,Moffat:2017feq}.
% in these models. 
For high-scale seesaws  with only fermionic singlets, light neutrino masses are inversely proportional to large LNV mass scales,
%,
%
and again lepton number is approximately conserved at low energies.
%This in turn leads to the expectation that 
Thus LNV processes are suppressed in type I seesaw models
(unless additional particles
%whether they be 
%fermions or scalars 
%charged under the SM gauge couplings or 
%new gauge interactions,
are introduced to decouple the light neutrino mass generation from heavy neutrino production).
%The updated discovery potential of heavy, SM singlet neutrinos at $pp$ colliders is now summarized.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------

If kinematically accessible, heavy neutrinos $N$ can be produced in hadron collisions through neutral current and charged current processes,
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lhcSeesaw_ISS} (upper).
The expected suppression of LNV processes in type I seesaw models 
%that contain only fermionic gauge singlets
motivates the study of lepton number conserving (LNC) processes, such as 
the heavy neutrino $N$ production via DY and VBF, with subsequent decays to only leptons, 
\begin{equation}
 p p \to \ell_N N +X \to \ell_N \ell_W W +X \to \ell_N \ell_W \ell_\nu \nu +X,
 \label{eq:pp3lX}
\end{equation}
giving the trilepton final state, $\ell^\pm_i \ell^\mp_j \ell^\pm_k + \textrm{MET}$.
Projections from a new tri-lepton search strategy recently proposed in Ref.~\cite{Pascoli:2018rsg}, 
based on a dynamical jet veto selection cut, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhcSeesaw_ISS}, assuming the benchmark mixing hypotheses
 $\vert V_{e4}\vert = \vert V_{\tau4} \vert$ with $\vert V_{\mu4}\vert = 0$ (left panel) and
 $\vert V_{\mu4}\vert = \vert V_{\tau4} \vert$ with $\vert V_{e4}\vert = 0$ (right panel), for $\sqrt{s}=14,~27$ and $100$ TeV.
For benchmark luminosities, the colliders can probe active-sterile mixing as small as (approximately) $\vert V_{\ell 4}\vert^2 \sim 5\times10^{-4} - 9\times10^{-5}$
and masses as heavy as (approximately) $1.5-15$ TeV for $\vert V_{\ell 4}\vert^2 \sim 10^{-2}$.

Another possibility is to search for lepton flavor violating (LFV) final states such as
\begin{equation}
 q ~\overline{q}' \to  ~N ~\ell^\pm_1 \to ~\ell^\pm_1 ~\ell^\mp_2 ~ W^\mp  \to ~\ell^\pm_1 ~\ell^\mp_2 ~j ~j.
 \label{eq:LFVfinalstate}
\end{equation}
This was, e.g., studied in Ref~\cite{Arganda:2015ija} in the context of the inverse seesaw (ISS), a low-scale variant of the type I seesaw.
Due to strong experimental limits on $\mu\to e\gamma$ by
MEG~\cite{Adam:2013mnn}, the event rates involving taus are more promising
than those for $e^\pm \mu^\mp jj$.
%Following~\cite{Arganda:2015ija}, the number of $\tau^\pm \mu^\mp jj$ can
%be estimated using the $\mu_X$-parametrization~\cite{Arganda:2014dta}
%with the neutrino Yukawa coupling
%\begin{equation}
% Y_{\nu}=f \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
%-1&1&0\\
%1&1&0.9\\
%1&1&1
%\end{array}\right)\,.
%\label{eq:Ytmmax1}
%\end{equation}
%as a representative example, and considering that only the lightest
%pseudo-Dirac pair is kinematically available.
%The number of events for this channel 
%is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lhcSeesaw_ISS}
%(L) and (R) for $\sqrt{s} = 14$ and 27~TeV, respectively, although similar
%numbers would be expected for $\tau^\pm e^\mp jj$.
After  $\mathcal L=3~\rm{ab}^{-1}$ of data taking, more than 100 LFV
events of $\tau^\pm \mu^\mp jj$ type could be produced for neutrino masses below 700 (1000)
GeV for $pp$ collisions at 14 (27)~TeV.

In the presence of additional particles that can decouple the heavy neutrino production 
from the light neutrino mass generation, e.g., new but far off-shell gauge bosons~\cite{Ruiz:2017nip},
the Majorana nature of the heavy neutrinos can lead to striking LNV collider signatures,
such as the well-studied same-sign dilepton and jets process~\cite{Keung:1983uu}
\begin{equation}
 pp \rightarrow  ~N ~\ell^\pm_1 \rightarrow ~\ell^\pm_1 ~\ell^\pm_2 ~ W^\mp  \rightarrow ~\ell^\pm_1 ~\ell^\pm_2 +nj.
 \label{eq:LNVfinalstate}
\end{equation}
Assuming that a low-scale type I seesaw is responsible for the heavy neutrino production, 
Fig. \ref{fig:SeesawIDiscoveryPotential} displays the discovery potential and active-heavy
mixing sensitivity of the $\mu^\pm\mu^\pm$ channel~\cite{Alva:2014gxa}.
Assuming the  pessimistic/conservative mixing scenario of $S_{\mu\mu} = 1.1\times10^{-3}$~\cite{Alva:2014gxa}, %\pf{pessimistic mixing not defined} 
the HL-LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ 
would be able to discover a heavy neutrino with a mass of $m_N\simeq400\,\mathrm{GeV}$ 
and is sensitive to masses up to $550\,\mathrm{GeV}$ at $3\sigma$. 
Using only 1 ab$^{-1}$, the HL-LHC can improve on the preexisting mixing constraints summarized in the pessimistic scenario 
for neutrino masses up to $500\,\mathrm{GeV}$.

The Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) 
%remains one of the best motivated high-energy completions of the SM.
%It 
addresses the origin of both tiny neutrino masses via a Type I+II seesaw hybrid mechanism 
as well as the SM $V-A$ chiral structure through spontaneous breaking of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry. 
%amongst other low-energy phenomena.
The model predicts new heavy gauge bosons $(W_R^\pm,~Z_R')$,
heavy Majorana neutrinos $(N)$, and a plethora of neutral and electrically charged scalars $(H_i^0,~H_j^\pm,~H_k^{\pm\pm})$.
%Unlike U$(1)_{BL}$ neutrino mass models, t
The LRSM gauge couplings are fixed to the SM Weak coupling constant, up to (small) RG-running corrections.
As a result, the Drell-Yan production mechanisms for $W_R$ and $Z_R$ result in large rates at hadron colliders.
%Following the procedure of \cite{Mitra:2016kov}, the $pp\to W_R^\pm$ cross section at NLO+NNLL(Threshold) 
%is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lrsm_HLvsHE_LHC}(upper left) as a function of mass $M_{W_R}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ and 27 TeV.
%At $\sqrt{s}=14~(27)$ TeV, one sees that production cross sections for masses as large as $M_{W_R}\approx 5.5~(9)$ TeV are in excess of 1 fb.
%For $M_{W_R}\approx 7.5~(12.5)$ TeV, rates exceed 100 ab, 
%and indicate $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$ events can be collected with $\mathcal{L}=1-15$ ab$^{-1}$ of data.
%Such computations up to NLO in QCD with parton shower matching, including for more generic coupling,
%are also publicly available following \cite{Mattelaer:2016ynf,Fuks:2017vtl}.
 

%Of the many collider predictions the LRSM, o
One of the most promising discovery channels is the production of heavy Majorana neutrinos
from resonant $W_R$, with $N$ decaying via a lepton number-violating final state. At the partonic level, the process is 
%this is given by
~\cite{Keung:1983uu} (for details see \cite{Cai:2017mow} and references therein)
\begin{equation}
 q_1 \overline{q}_2 \to W_R \to N ~\ell^\pm_i \to \ell_i^\pm \ell_j^\pm W_R^{\mp *} \to \ell_i^\pm \ell_j^\pm q_1' \overline{q_2'}.
 \label{eq:seesawLRSMDY}
\end{equation}
%and has been extensively studied throughout the literature. .
Due to the ability to fully reconstruct \eqref{eq:seesawLRSMDY}, many properties of $W_R$ and $N$ can be extracted,
including a complete determination of $W_R$ chiral couplings to quarks independent of leptons~\cite{Han:2012vk}.
Beyond the canonical $pp \to W_R \to N\ell \to 2\ell + 2j$ channel, it may be the case that the heavy neutrino is hierarchically lighter than the 
right-handed (RH) gauge bosons. 
Notably, for $(m_N/M_{W_R})\lesssim0.1$, $N$ is sufficiently Lorentz boosted that its decay products, particularly the charged lepton, 
are too collimated to be resolved experimentally~\cite{Ferrari:2000sp,Mitra:2016kov}.
%
Instead, one can consider the $(\ell_j^\pm q_1' \overline{q_2'})$-system as a single object, a \textit{neutrino jet}~\cite{Mitra:2016kov,Mattelaer:2016ynf}.
The hadronic process is then
%\begin{equation}
 $ p p \to W_R \to N\ell_i^\pm \to j_N ~\ell_i^\pm$,
 %
and inherits much of the desired properties of \eqref{eq:seesawLRSMDY},

In Type II scenarios, $H^{\pm\pm}$ decays to $\tau^\pm \tau^\pm$ and $\mu^\pm \mu^\pm$ pairs are comparable or greater than the
$e^\pm e^\pm$ channel by two orders of magnitude. 
Moreover, the $\tau \mu$ channel is typically dominant in decays involving different lepton flavors~\cite{Perez:2008ha,Li:2018jns}.
If such a seesaw is realized in nature, tau polarizations can help to determine the chiral property of triplet scalars.
One can discriminate between different heavy scalar mediated neutrino mass mechanisms, e.g., between Type II seesaw and Zee-Babu model, 
by studying the distributions of tau lepton decay products~\cite{Sugiyama:2012yw,Li:2018jns}. 
Due to the low $\tau_h$ identification efficiencies, 
future colliders with high energy and/or luminosity enables one to investigate and search for doubly charged Higgs decaying to $\tau_h$ pairs.

as well as  tau polarization effects~\cite{Li:2018jns},

Low-scale Type III seesaws introduce heavy electrically charged $(E^\pm)$ and neutral $(N)$ leptons, 
part of SU$(2)_L$ triplet,
that couple to both SM charged and neutral leptons through mixing/Yukawa couplings.
Triplet leptons couple appreciably to EW gauge bosons,  
and thus do not have suppressed production cross section, contrary to seesaw scenarios with gauge singlet fermions.
Up to small (and potentially negligible) mixing effects 
%The presence of electroweak gauge couplings also implies that once a collider energy and mass are stipulated, 
the triplet lepton 
pair production cross sections are fully determined, see Fig. \ref{fig:lhcSeesawtype3} (upper) for relevant tree level diagrams for the production of heavy charged leptons.
%Production mechanisms  include charged current and neutral current Drell-Yan, photon fusion, and gluon fusion if one considers heavy-light charged lepton associated production, see Fig. \ref{fig:lhcSeesawtype3} (upper).
%A recent assessment of triplet production modes found~\cite{Cai:2017mow} that despite the sizable luminosities
%afforded to gluon fusion $(gg\to E^\pm\ell^\mp)$, including its large QCD corrections~\cite{Ruiz:2017yyf},
%and photon fusion $(\gamma\gamma\to E^+E^-)$, the 
Drell-Yan processes are the dominant production channel of triplet leptons when kinematically accessible~\cite{Cai:2017mow}.
%In light of this, in 
Fig. \ref{fig:lhcSeesawtype3} (lower left) shows 
the summed cross sections for the Drell-Yan processes,

$ pp\to \gamma^*/Z^* \to E^+E^-$, and  
$ pp\to W^{\pm *} \to E^\pm N$,

%are shown
 at NLO in QCD, following \cite{Ruiz:2015zca}, as a function of triplet masses (assuming $m_N = m_E$), at $\sqrt{s}=14$ and 27 TeV.
%For $m_{N},m_{E} \approx 1.2~(1.8)$ TeV,  the production rate reaches $\sigma(pp\to NE+EE)\approx 1$ fb at $\sqrt{s}=14~(27)$ TeV; and for heavier leptons with $m_{N},m_{E} \approx 2.5~(4.2)$ TeV, 
%one sees that $\sigma(pp\to NE+EE)\approx 1$ ab.


Another consequence of the triplet leptons coupling to all EW bosons is the adherence to the Goldstone Equivalence Theorem.
This implies that triplet leptons with masses well above the EW scale
will preferentially decay to longitudinal polarized $W$ and $Z$ bosons as well as to the Higgs bosons. 
For decays of EW boson to jets or charged lepton pairs, triplet lepton can be fully reconstructed from their final-state 
enabling their properties to be studied in detail.

which correspond approximately to the branching fractions $\BR(NE)\approx0.115$ and $\BR(EE)\approx0.116$,
search strategies such as those considered in \cite{Arhrib:2009mz,Li:2009mw} can be enacted.

\subsection{Implications of TeV scale flavour models for electroweak baryogenesis} 
{\it\small Author(s) (TH): Oleksii Matsedonskyi, Geraldine Servant}

%Intro: EWBG

In most solutions to the SM flavour puzzle, Yukawa couplings have a dynamical origin, which means that they potentially impact the cosmological evolution.
% should be studied.
 In Refs.~\cite{Baldes:2016rqn,Baldes:2016gaf,vonHarling:2016vhf,Bruggisser:2017lhc,Bruggisser:2018mus,Bruggisser:2018mrt,Baldes:2018nel,Servant:2018xcs},  such connections between flavour and cosmology, in particular with the  electroweak baryogenesis,  have been investigated in detail.

Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) is a mechanism to explain the matter antimatter asymmetry of the universe  using baryon number violation already present in the SM. It 
 relies on a charge transport mechanism in the vicinity of bubble walls during a first-order electroweak (EW) phase transition. EWBG uses EW scale physics only and is therefore testable experimentally. It requires an extension of the Higgs sector, giving a first-order EW phase transition as well as new sources of CP violation. Typically, there are stringent constraints on EWBG models from bounds on Electric Dipole Moments.
 In the following,  we consider that the source of CP violation has changed with time, which is a natural way to evade constraints. 
 The main motivation is to link EWBG to low-scale flavour models.  If the physics responsible for the structure of the Yukawa couplings is linked to EW symmetry breaking, we can expect the Yukawa couplings to vary at the same time as the Higgs is acquiring a VEV, in particular if the flavour structure is controlled by a new scalar field which couples to the Higgs.
 This is  precisely what can happen in Composite Higgs (CH) models ~\cite{Kaplan:1983fs,Panico:2015jxa}, on which we focus in the following.


%Intro: CH

The  Composite Higgs (CH) models assume that the Higgs boson arises as a bound state of a new strong interaction, confining around the TeV scale $f$. Other composite resonances are naturally heavier than the Higgs, due to an approximate Goldstone symmetry suppressing the Higgs mass. The rest of the SM fields do not belong to the strong sector and are elementary. The nature of the EW phase transition in CH models can be substantially different with respect to the SM. One of the reasons is that the CH models naturally feature new scalar resonances that participate in the EW phase transition and change its properties (see Refs.~\cite{Espinosa:2011eu,Chala:2016ykx}). On the other hand, the EW transition may become strongly first order even without the help of such additional states, if the EW transition happens simultaneously with the deconfinement-confinement phase transition of the new strong sector (see Refs.~\cite{Bruggisser:2018mus,Bruggisser:2018mrt} and also Refs.~\cite{vonHarling:2016vhf,Megias:2018sxv} for the dual description in the warped 5D space).    

%Flavour in CH

The flavour structure of the CH models is intimately tied with the viability of EWBG. The requirement of having a sizeable top quark Yukawa coupling, while suppressing the unwanted flavour-violating effects, suggests that the new sector is nearly scale-invariant
% and strongly coupled 
for a large range of energies above the confinement scale. As a result, one may expect that the transition dynamics is mostly determined by a single light field -- the dilaton $\chi$ (see e.g Ref.~\cite{Coradeschi:2013gda}). Depending on its mass, whose size can be related to the separation of the UV flavour scale and the EW scale, the EW phase transition may happen separately from the confinement, or simultaneously with it~\cite{Bruggisser:2018mus,Bruggisser:2018mrt}. %The two-step transition is expected to happen for the heavier dilaton, while the one-step -- for the dilaton lighter than about $\sim 0.5$~TeV. 

Moreover, the mechanism for generating the SM flavour hierarchy in CH models may also be a source of CP asymmetry during the EW phase transition. The hierarchy of SM Yukawas $\lambda_q$ 
%\td{does it conform to Higgs section notation} 
is generated by the renormalization group running of the couplings $y_q$ between the elementary fermions and the strong sector operators, 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_q \propto y_q^2, \quad\text{with} \quad y_q=y_q^{\text{UV}} \left( \frac{\mu}{\Lambda_{\text{UV}}} \right)^{\gamma_{y_q}},
\end{equation}
where $\mu\sim \chi$ is the confinement scale, $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}$ is some large scale at which all the mixings are generated with a similar size, $y_q^{\text{UV}}$, and $\gamma_{y_q}$ is the anomalous dimension of the operator responsible for the mixing.
 This means that the size of the Yukawa couplings changes with the evolution of the confinement scale during the confinement phase transition. Such a change of the Yukawa interactions may efficiently source the CP-violation required for the baryogenesis~\cite{Bruggisser:2017lhc}.

\caption{Relative deviation of the Higgs couplings to $W$ and $Z$ bosons (left panel) and the imaginary part of the correction to the top quark Yukawa coupling (right panel), as functions of the dilaton mass, $m_\chi$, the number of colours, $N$, in the new confining sector, and generic mass of composite states, $m_*$. Solid black (red dashed) contours correspond to the glueball-like (meson-like) dilaton. The current  and near future experimental sensitivities of electron EDM experiments  to the imaginary part of the top yukawa correspond respectively to approximately $2\times 10^{-3}$ \cite{Andreev:2018ayy,Brod:2013cka}

and $2\times 10^{-4}$~\cite{Kumar:2013qya}.
}

\end{figure}

For both types of transitions  mentioned, one can expect to observe deviations of the Higgs couplings from the SM predictions. These deviations are result of contributions generic to CH models, as well as those linked to the features of the phase transition and new sources of CP-violation. For concreteness we focus on the  more minimal example, the combined electroweak and strong sector phase transition. 
%
The potential of the Higgs boson can be parametrized in terms of trigonometric functions of $h/f$, with the overall size of the potential controlled by the mixings between the elementary and composite fermions~\cite{Matsedonskyi:2012ym,Panico:2012uw},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewbg_vh}
V = c_1 \sin^2 \frac h f + c_2 \sin^4 \frac h f,
\end{equation}
where $c_1 \sim c_2 \sim \sum_q ({3 y_q^2}/{(4 \pi)^2}) g_\star^2 f^4$. The dependence of the $y_q$ mixings on the dilaton field is responsible for the mass mixing between the dilaton and the Higgs field, which we parametrise by an angle $\delta$.
To generate sufficient amount of CP violation, such mass mixing needs to be sizeable. Let us consider its effect on the quark Yukawa coupling:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewbg_yuk}
{\cal L}_{\rm Yukawa} = \lambda(\chi) \left(\chi \sin \frac h f \right) \bar q_L q_R 
= \bar q_L q_R h \left(\lambda(f) \frac {\chi}{f} + \beta_{\lambda} \frac {\chi - f }{f} \right) + \dots, 
\end{equation}
where we performed an expansion in $\chi$ around its present day value, $f$. Similar, but CP-preserving, modifications are also generated in the couplings of the Higgs boson to the SM gauge fields and the Higgs self-interactions.
The complex phase of the Yukawa beta-function, $\beta_\lambda$, in \eqref{eq:ewbg_yuk} has to be different from that of the quark mass $\lambda(f) h$, as the Yukawa phase changes with energy. 
Choosing the mass parameter to be real, the CP-violating interaction resides in the term $\propto \beta_\lambda$. Rotating the $h$ and $\chi$ fields to the mass basis, the CP-even and CP-odd corrections to the Higgs Yukawa  interaction are
\begin{equation}
\text{Re} [\delta \lambda] \sim \text{Re} [\beta_\lambda] \delta (v/f) + \lambda (\delta^2/2+\delta(v/f)) ,\quad
\text{Im} [\delta \lambda] \sim \text{Im} [\beta_\lambda]  \delta (v/f).
\end{equation} 
In Fig.~(\ref{fig:ewbg_observables}) we show the values of the CP-violating top quark Yukawa modification and the deviations of the Higgs couplings to the $W$ and $Z$ bosons.
Such couplings can be tested directly at the LHC, and also in the measurements of electric dipole moments.  
%In addition to the observables directly linked to the CP violation, t
The strength of the phase transition can be tested in gravitational waves signals at the future space-based observatory LISA~\cite{Caprini:2015zlo}.
