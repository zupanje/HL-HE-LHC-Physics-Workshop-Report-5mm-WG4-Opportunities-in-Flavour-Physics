\subsubsection{$B\rightarrow D^{(*)}l\nu$ form factors and anatomy of $R(D^{(*)})$}
Signs of LFUV have not only been seen in loop-suppressed flavor-changing 
neutral currents discussed above, but also in tree-level decays, namely, in tensions with the SM predictions for the ratios
\begin{equation}
  R(D^{(*)}) = \frac{\mathcal{B}(B \to D^{(*)}\tau\nu)}{\mathcal{B}(B \to D^{(*)}l\nu)},\,\hspace{0.5cm}(l=\mu,~e).
\end{equation}
Assuming for the moment the SM particle content only, the $b\to c\ell\nu_{\ell^\prime}$ transitions at scales near $m_b$ can be described by an $SU(3) \times U(1)$-invariant effective Hamiltonian,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Heffbcellnu}
  \mathcal H_\text{eff}^{b\to c\tau\nu} = \frac{4 G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{cb}
    \sum_{\ell\ell^\prime}\Big(\Blu{(\delta_{\ell\ell^\prime}+C_L^{\ell\ell^\prime})}O_{V_L}^{\ell\ell^\prime} + \sum_{i} C_i^{\ell\ell'} O_i^{\ell\ell'} + \text{h.c.}\Big),
\end{equation}
where $\ell,\ell'=e,\mu,\tau$ denotes the charged-lepton and neutrino flavor, respectively, and the sum over $i$ runs over the following operators,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ops}
\begin{split}
  O_{V_{L,R}}^{\ell\ell'} &= (\bar c_{L,R} \gamma^\mu b_{L,R})(\bar \ell_L \gamma_\mu \nu_{\ell' L}), 
  %
  \qquad O_{S_{L,R}}^{\ell\ell'} = (\bar c_{R,L} b_{L,R})(\bar \ell_R \nu_{\ell' L}), 
  \\
  O_T^{\ell\ell'} &= (\bar c_R \sigma^{\mu\nu} b_L)(\bar \ell_R \sigma_{\mu\nu}\nu_{\ell' L}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The NP coefficients $C_i^{\ell\ell'}$ depend, in general, on both charged-lepton and neutrino flavor. These operators arise from more fundamental interactions at a higher scale $\Lambda$ which, in accordance with available LHC data, can be taken to be larger than the electroweak scale $v˜$. The operators of Eq.~(\ref{eq:ops}) should then be embedded into $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ invariant operators composed of the full SM field content. For $C_{V_R}$ there is no contribution violating lepton-universality at dimension-6, leading to a parametric suppression of at least $v^2/\Lambda^2$ for tree-level ultraviolet (UV) completions. Linearly realized electroweak symmetry breaking, captured by the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT)~\cite{Buchmuller:1985jz,Grzadkowski:2010es}, also yields the prediction $C_{V_R}^{\ell\ell'} \equiv C_{V_R}\delta_{\ell\ell'}$~\cite{Cirigliano:2009wk,Cata:2015lta}. In this case, sizable contributions to $C_{V_R}$ are excluded by $b\to c(e,\mu)\nu$~\cite{Jung:2018lfu}. While deviations from this prediction are possible in a non-linear realization of electroweak symmetry breaking~\cite{Cata:2015lta}, at least one of the above-named sources of suppression always remains and right-handed currents do not play a role.

The relevant hadronic matrix elements of the SM operator $O_{V_L}^{\ell\ell}$, i.e., $ \bra{D} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu b \ket{\bar{B}}$, $\bra{D^*} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu b \ket{\bar{B}}$, and 
$\bra{D^*} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 b \ket{\bar{B}}$, are parametrized using one, two, and three form factors, respectively~\cite{Caprini:1997mu}.

The helicity form factors obey unitarity bounds which can be written in an elegant way using the parametrization of Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) \cite{Boyd:1997kz}. The contributions of the helicity form factors $S_1$ and $P_1$ \Blu{(as defined in~\cite{Caprini:1997mu})} to the branching ratios of $B\rightarrow Dl\nu$ and $B\rightarrow D^*l\nu$ are
suppressed by the mass of the final-state lepton. In view of the lack of experimental information on these form factors we need  input from theory. 
In the case of $B \to D$, we are in the fortunate position that lattice results
for both $V_1$ and $S_1$ at $w\geq 1$ exist~\cite{Lattice:2015rga,Na:2015kha,Aoki:2016frl}, where $w = (m_B^2 + m_{D^{(*)}}^2-q^2)/(2 m_B m_{D^{(*)}})$.
This is the reason for the very good agreement of all SM predictions in this case, see Table~\ref{tab:RD-and-RDstar-anomaly}. \Blu{Recently, also soft photon corrections to $R(D)$ have been discussed~\cite{deBoer:2018ipi}.}
For $B \to D^*$, we have only one data point from lattice, namely $A_1(w=1)$~\cite{Bailey:2014tva,Harrison:2017fmw} so that it is necessary to use 
Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET)~\cite{Bernlochner:2017jka,Caprini:1997mu,Luke:1990eg,Neubert:1991xw,Neubert:1993mb,Neubert:1992wq,Neubert:1992pn,Ligeti:1993hw}
to relate the $B \to D$ and $B \to D^*$ form factors order-by-order in the heavy quark expansion in terms of Isgur--Wise functions
in order to obtain a prediction for $P_1$ and hence $R(D^*)$. 

At NLO in the heavy-quark expansion, {i.e.}, expanding to linear order in $\alpha_s/\pi$ and $1/m_{c,b}$,
there is sufficient differential information in the $B \to D^{(*)}l\nu$ decays to fit to the four Isgur-Wise functions
that arise at this order \cite{Bernlochner:2017jka,Jaiswal:2017rve}. 
In the literature the theoretical error from using NLO HQET results is under discussion, leading to different 
results for the error of the SM prediction. 
HQET can also be used to obtain a stronger version of the unitarity bounds
%
(see Refs.~\cite{Boyd:1997kz,Bigi:2017jbd} for details).
Additional model-dependent theoretical input at maximal $w$ can be provided by Light Cone Sum Rules (LCSR)~\cite{Faller:2008tr,Gubernari:2018wyi},
or at zero recoil by QCD sum rules~\cite{Neubert:1992wq,Neubert:1992pn,Neubert:1993mb,Ligeti:1993hw}.
We give a summary of theoretical predictions for $R(D^{(*)})$ in Table~\ref{tab:RD-and-RDstar-anomaly}.

Since lattice data is presently available only at zero recoil for $B \to D^*$
and the kinematic suppression requires $d\Gamma[B \to D^*l\nu]/dw$ to vanish at $w=1$,  $|V_{cb}|$ can be obtained from $B \to D^*l\nu$ only by extrapolating $d\Gamma[B \to D^*l\nu]/dw$ back to zero recoil. 
This procedure can be highly sensitive to the chosen form-factor parameterization and other theoretical inputs;
for recent analyses, see 
Refs.~\cite{Abdesselam:2017kjf,Bigi:2017njr,Bigi:2017jbd,Grinstein:2017nlq,Bernlochner:2017jka,Bernlochner:2017xyx,Jaiswal:2017rve,Harrison:2017fmw,Schacht:2017vfd}. 
Lattice data beyond zero recoil is expected soon (see \cite{Aviles-Casco:2017nge} for preliminary results)
from both domain wall and AsqTad ensemble approaches. 
Combined with abundant future data for $B \to D^*l\nu$ from HL-LHC, extractions of $|V_{cb}|$ that are less sensitive to theoretical inputs
will become possible, thereby either resolving or more concretely establishing tensions between exclusive and inclusive measurements of $|V_{cb}|$.

With future experimental data and lattice QCD results (see Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice} and Table~\ref{table:Proj} therein) the SM 
prediction of $R(D^*)$ will improve considerably. For an estimate, one may note that the dependence of $d\Gamma/dw$ on the $P_1$ form factor arises 
only incoherently, via a contribution of the form $m_l^2|P_1(w)|^2$. This $P_1$ term contributes approximately 10\% of the total 
integrated $B \to D^*\tau\nu$ rate, which suggests that the dependence of $R(D^*)$ on this form factor should be limited. 
Assuming a 1\% future precision for $P_1$, using the 50 ab$^{-1}$ which Belle~II will presumably gather by 2025, and taking into 
account the expected improvement of the form factors $A_{1,5}$ and $V_4$ from the lattice, it is hence reasonable to assume that
an error of 0.001 for the SM value of $R(D^*)$ might be achieved.

\subsubsection{Excited states and other $b$ hadrons: $R(D^{**})$, $R(J/\psi)$, $R(\Lambda_c^{(*)})$ and $R(X_c)$}

Measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ and lepton universality can also be probed via $B$ decays to the $D^{**}$ excited states,
as well as decays of strange or charmed $b$ hadrons, including $B_s \to D^{(*)}_s$, $B_c \to J/\psi$,
and the baryonic $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^{(*)}$ transitions. In comparison to the $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ decay modes, these modes may 
variously exhibit higher sensitivities to specific NP operators or, in some cases,
may be theoretically cleaner than the decays to the $D^{(*)}$ ground states. 
These modes can also be important downfeed or crossfeed backgrounds to the $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ decays and,
to the extent they are affected by the same NP operators, must also be understood and measured carefully.
The HL-LHC is the only experiment planned that will yield significant samples of these heavier $b$-hadrons, 
with precision analyses anticipated from the LHCb experiment.
In this subsection we present the motivations and theoretical prospects for the measurement of each of these \Blu{exclusive decay modes, 
as well as for measurement of inclusive semileptonic $B$ decays.}

The $D^{**}$ excited states comprise four different charmed hadrons: The $D_0^*$, $D_1^*$, $D_1$, $D_2^*$.
In the language of HQET, these furnish two doublets, $\{D_0^*\,,D_1^*\}$ and $\{D_1\,,D_2^*\}$,
with spin-parity $s_{\ell}^{\pi_\ell} = \frac{1}{2}^+$ and $\frac{3}{2}^+$, respectively.
(In the heavy-quark limit, spin-parity is a conserved quantum number.)
The $\frac{3}{2}^+$ states are narrow, with $\Gamma \sim 30$--$50$\,MeV,
because their hadronic decays to $D^{(*)}\pi$ either proceed via a $D$-wave or violate heavy quark-symmetry,
while the $\frac{1}{2}^+$ states are quite broad.  Although isolating these excited-state decays will likely be simpler at $e^+e^-$ $B$ factories, 
which can more easily reconstruct $\pi^0$'s and photons, analyses of $B \to D^{**}\ell\nu$ decays are also feasible at LHCb \upgradetwo, 
especially for the narrow $\frac{3}{2}^+$ states subsequently decaying to charged hadrons.

The crucial attractive feature of the $B \to D^{**}$ transitions is that various leading-order contributions to the form factors
vanish in the heavy-quark limit at zero recoil ($w=1$), so that $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/m_{c,b})$ corrections
become important~\cite{Leibovich:1997tu,Leibovich:1997em,Bernlochner:2012bc,Bernlochner:2016bci}. 
The richer structure of the subleading form-factor contributions has the consequence that sensitivity to various NP currents
can be much larger than in the ground state decays~\cite{Bernlochner:2016bci, Bernlochner:2017jxt}. 
For example, including only a NP tensor operator, $O^{\ell\ell^\prime}_T$, one finds the ratios
$R(X)/R(X)_{\text{SM}} \simeq \{1.5, 1.3\}$ for $X = \{D, D^*\}$ at the best fit to the $R(D^{(*)})$ data. 
However, the same Wilson coefficients result in $R(X)/R(X)_{\text{SM}}$ greater than $4.0$ or less than $0.5$ for $X=\{D_0^*, D_1^*, D_1, D_2^*\}$. \Blu{Interference between different $B\to D^{**}$ transitions also offers the possibility to probe for new CP-violating phases in the NP operators~\cite{Aloni:2018ipm}.}
The current SM predictions for all four modes, from fits to Belle data including NLO HQET contributions, are~\cite{Bernlochner:2017jxt}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RDDs}
  R(D_0^*) = 0.08 \pm 0.03,\quad  R(D_1^*) = 0.05 \pm 0.02, \quad
  %
  R(D_1) =  0.10 \pm 0.02,\quad  R(D_2^*) = 0.07 \pm 0.01\,.
\end{equation}

Decays of $B$ mesons to these excited states have total SM branching ratios comparable to the $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ decays themselves.
Combined with the possible large enhancement of the semitauonic modes by NP contributions,
this means that the subsequent $D^{**} \to D^{(*)}X$ decays can then induce important downfeed  backgrounds to the $D^{(*)}$ measurements.
Analyses of $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ will therefore typically have to fold in contributions from these excited states.
Moreover, anticipated analyses for the inclusive $B \to D\pi\ell\nu$ decays provide an opportunity to probe these excited-state decays
and their associated larger NP sensitivities collectively with the ground-state decays.
In this context, rather than being thought of as a background, these contributions should be more properly thought of as additional sources of (NP) signal.
The large data sets from HL-LHC will then provide a very sensitive set of channels for probing NP contributions to $b \to c \ell \nu$.

The $B_s$ and $B_c$ mesons have production ratios $\sigma(B_s)/\sigma(b\bar{b}) \sim 10\%$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-004}
and $\sigma(B_c)/\sigma(b\bar{b}) \sim 0.2\%$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-044} in Run 1 LHC.
A much smaller sample of $B_s$ mesons may also be produced at $B$ factories running on the $\Upsilon(5S)$ resonance.
However, for the $B_c$ the only significant sample of mesons will be produced at HL-LHC.
At first glance, the theoretical structure of $B_s \to D_s^{(*,**)}\ell\nu$ can be mapped directly from $B \to D^{(*,**)}\ell\nu$
via the approximate $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry.
Some crucial differences are that $\mathcal{B}(D_s^{*} \to D_s\gamma) \simeq 94\%$, which will be difficult to see at LHCb \upgradetwo,
while the four $D_s^{**}$ excited states are all narrow, and therefore may be easier to resolve.

The leptonic $B_c \to (J/\psi \to \mu\mu) \ell \nu$ decay mode is reasonably clean experimentally, with measurements for $R(J/\psi)$ already available from LHCb Run 1 data,
%
$  R(J/\psi) = 0.71 \pm 0.17\,\text{(stat)}\, \pm 0.18\,\text{(sys)}$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2017-035},
%
albeit with large uncertainties at present. A central difficulty in probing this mode lies in the large theoretical uncertainties for the $B_c \to J/\psi$ form-factor parameterizations. Predictions for the form factors are typically hadronic-model-dependent, making use of either perturbative QCD, the constituent-quark model, the (non)relativitistic quark model, or QCD sum rules~\cite{Anisimov:1998uk,Kiselev:1999sc,Ivanov:2000aj,Kiselev:2002vz,Hernandez:2006gt,Ivanov:2006ni,Wen-Fei:2013uea,Qiao:2012vt,Rui:2016opu}. The LHCb results have motivated several studies of the form factors~\cite{Dutta:2017xmj,Tran:2018kuv,Issadykov:2018myx,Watanabe:2017mip}. A recent, more model-independent result combines preliminary lattice QCD results with dispersive bounds and zero-recoil heavy-quark relations, leading to the prediction
%
$  0.20 \le R(J/\psi) \le 0.39$~\cite{Cohen:2018dgz}, 
%
at $95\%$ CL, implying a mild tension at the $1.3\sigma$ level with the data.

Abundant samples of $\Lambda_b$'s will be produced only at (HL-)LHC, with a production cross-section $\sigma(\Lambda_b)/\sigma(b\bar{b}) \sim 10\%$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2011-018}. 
From an HQET point of view, the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c$ transitions are theoretically cleaner than the $B \to D^{(*)}$ decays,
because the ``brown muck'' dressing the heavy quark lies in the $s_{\ell}^{\pi_\ell}= 0^+$ ground state.
A consequence of this is a relatively simpler form-factor structure, where not only the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$
but also the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_{c,b})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s/m_{c,b})$ subleading contributions
are fully fixed by the leading-order HQET structure, reducing the number of free parameters in the form-factor fits.
These modes are therefore promising, clean candidates for testing the behavior of the HQET expansion itself,
by e.g., assessing the impact of $\mathcal{O}(1/m_c^2)$ contributions.
Fitting the subsubleading $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s, \alpha_s/m_{c,b}, 1/m_c^2)$ HQET structure to existing LHCb data~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2017-016}
and lattice form factor results~\cite{Detmold:2015aaa} implies such terms are of the expected size~\cite{Bernlochner:2018kxh}. 
More $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \ell \nu$ data from LHCb will improve the precision of these results, allowing access to other subleading terms.
Moreover, with precision lattice calculations of the form factors (see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{Detmold:2015aaa}), 
additional data for these modes may permit precision measurement of $|V_{cb}|$ in an environment with reduced theoretical uncertainties.

\Blu{The heavy quark expansion is also applicable to $\Lambda_b$ transitions into excited
    $\Lambda_c^* = \Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2625)$ states \cite{Leibovich:1997az}.
    The complexity of the HQET description lies between that of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c$
    and $B\to D^{(*)}$ transitions, with two unknown functions up to $\mathcal{O}(1/m_{c,b})$.
   It was recently demonstrated that simultaneous binned likelihood fits to the rich angular distributions
   of $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c^*\mu\bar\nu$ decays can determine these two functions
   and produce data-driven predictions of $R(\Lambda_c^*)$~\cite{Boer:2018vpx}. The projected
   precision due to parametric effects reaches $\sim 2\%$ for the LHCb Upgrade 1 data set.
   Due to the spin structure of the $\Lambda_c^*$ states, these decays provide a
   complementary LFU probe with a different set of systematic uncertainties
   when compared to $R(D^{(*)})$ and $R(\Lambda_c)$. More data from LHCb will similarly improve the precision of these results.}

\Blu{
Also of interest is the measurement of the inclusive process $B \to X_c \ell \nu$, where $X_c$ can be a multibody charmed state of arbitrary invariant mass, and the associated ratio $R(X_c)$. In the heavy quark limit $m_b \to \infty$, the amplitude for this process corresponds simply to that of the free quark decay $b \to c \ell \nu$. Corrections to the heavy quark limit are obtained via an OPE in terms of local heavy-quark operators: SM predictions exist at $\mathcal{O}(1/m_b^2)$ including two-loop QCD corrections~\cite{Ligeti:2014kia,Freytsis:2015qca}, yielding
\begin{equation}
    R(X_c) = 0.223 \pm 0.004\,.
\end{equation}
Combining this with the inclusive measurement $\BR(B \to X_c e \nu) = (10.65 \pm 0.16)\%$~\cite{Amhis:2016xyh} implies $\text{Br}[B \to X_c \tau \nu] = (2.38 \pm 0.05)\%$. This is in good agreement with the LEP measurement $\BR(b \to X \tau \nu)= (2.41 \pm 0.23) \%$~\cite{PDG2018}, where $X$ can be any multibody state. However, the present measurements for $\BR(B \to D \tau \nu) + \BR(B \to D^* \tau \nu) = (2.71 \pm 0.18)\%$~\cite{Freytsis:2015qca}, when further combined with the SM predictions for $\BR(B \to D^{**}\tau\nu)$~\cite{Bernlochner:2016bci, Bernlochner:2017jxt}, implies $\BR(B \to X_c \tau \nu)  > (2.8 \pm 0.2)\%$, already well in excess of the SM prediction for the semitauonic inclusive process. An indirect $R(X_c)$ anomaly then arises independent from the details of the form factor parameterizations involved in $R(D^{(*)})$. Given these tensions, and since measurement of the inclusive process would involve both different theory uncertainties and different systematics compared to the exclusive modes, direct measurement of $B \to X_c\tau\nu$ is of high interest in further understanding the $b \to c \tau \nu$ anomalies. 
}

\subsubsection{Models of NP for $b\to c\tau\nu$}
\label{sec7:ModelsNP:bctaunu}
%

%
A possible NP origin of the deviations in $R(D^{(*)})$ requires a large 
%
contribution with respect to the SM. 
%
Defining $\hat{R}(X)=R(X)/R(X)|_{\rm SM}$, we have with present data $\hat{R}(D)=1.36 \pm 0.15$ and $\hat{R}(D^*)=1.19 \pm 0.06$. This points to $\gtrsim 10\%$ NP contribution to the amplitude  when the SM and NP contributions interfere, and 
%
$\gtrsim 40\%$ if they do not. 
%
\Blu{The scale of NP for the $R(D^{(*)})$ anomaly is then
%
%
\begin{equation}
 \Lambda_\text{NP} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|V_{cb}|}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\Delta C_i|}} \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} \sim \frac{1~\text{TeV}}{\sqrt{|\Delta C_i|}}~,
\end{equation}
%
and the contributions are expected to enter at} tree level. Possible mediators, assuming they couple only to SM fields, were classified in~\cite{Freytsis:2015qca}. If the present central values $R(D^{(*)})$ are sustained, 
%
this anomaly will be established by the time of the measurements at HL/HE-LHC, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:projections} left. The focus will hence shift to model differentiation in $b\to c\tau\nu$ and the analysis of the lepton- and quark-flavor structure of the NP contributions.
%
A completely general NP analysis will require theoretical care. For instance, form-factor determinations from $b\to c \ell \nu$ decays could also be sensitive to NP contributions, subject to the constraint that extractions of $|V_{cb}|$ from these  decays can be made consistent with all other global data on CKM unitarity. Consequently, experimentally determined form-factor parameters may require a simultaneous fit to the deviations or additional determinations of form-factor ratios, which, however, are expected to be available at the required precision by the start of HL/HE-LHC. See Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice} for corresponding prospects from lattice QCD.

are a $W'$~\cite{Greljo:2015mma,Boucenna:2016wpr,Boucenna:2016qad,Megias:2017ove} generating $C_{V_L}$, a charged color-neutral scalar~\cite{Crivellin:2012ye,Celis:2012dk,Crivellin:2015hha,Celis:2016azn,Chen:2017eby,Iguro:2017ysu,Chen:2018hqy,Li:2018rax} generating $C_{S_{L,R}}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Heffbcellnu}), and leptoquarks~\cite{Fajfer:2012jt,Deshpande:2012rr,Sakaki:2013bfa,Duraisamy:2014sna,Calibbi:2015kma,Fajfer:2015ycq,Barbieri:2015yvd,Alonso:2015sja,Bauer:2015knc,Das:2016vkr,Deshpand:2016cpw,Sahoo:2016pet,Dumont:2016xpj,Li:2016vvp,Becirevic:2016yqi,Barbieri:2016las,DiLuzio:2017vat,Chen:2017hir,Bordone:2017bld,Altmannshofer:2017poe,Becirevic:2018afm,Iguro:2018vqb} generating various couplings, mostly $C_{V_L}$ or $C_{S_L} \sim C_T$. For comparisons between these models,  see for instance~\cite{Tanaka:2012nw,Freytsis:2015qca,Bhattacharya:2016zcw,Ivanov:2017mrj,Alok:2017qsi,Bifani:2018zmi,Blanke:2018yud}.
Allowing for additional light particles opens up the possibility to address the anomalies with contributions involving right-handed neutrinos~\cite{He:2012zp,He:2017bft,Becirevic:2016yqi,Greljo:2018ogz,Asadi:2018wea,Robinson:2018gza,Azatov:2018kzb,Heeck:2018ntp}, since the neutrino is not detected.

\Blu{In order to differentiate between the different combinations of NP operators that these models produce at low energies,} information beyond $R(D^{(*)})$ is needed. Presently, the available additional observables in $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions are: {\em (i)} differential distributions in $q^2$~\cite{Lees:2013uzd,Huschle:2015rga} already excluding some fine-tuned scenarios despite their large uncertainties; {\em (ii)} the first measurements of the $\tau$ polarization asymmetry and the longitudinal fraction in $B\to D^*\tau\nu$~\cite{Hirose:2016wfn,Hirose:2017dxl}; {\em (iii)} the measurement of $R(J/\psi)$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2017-035}, which is up to $2\sigma$ above the SM prediction, as well as that of any NP model (see the previous subsection); {\em (iv)} the measurement of the inclusive rate $b\to X\tau\nu$ at \Blu{LEP~\cite{Abbaneo:2001bv,PDG2018}, yielding $\hat R(X_c)=1.01\pm0.10$}, in slight tension with the measurements for $R(D^{(*)})$~\cite{Ligeti:2014kia,Freytsis:2015qca,Celis:2016azn,Mannel:2017jfk}; {\it (v)} the (indirect) bound on $B_c \to \tau\nu$ from the $B_c$ lifetime~\cite{Li:2016vvp,Alonso:2016oyd,Akeroyd:2017mhr}, providing a strong constraint on models with only scalar couplings and disfavoring them as a solution for $R(D^*)$ for values close to the present central value.

Additional indirect constraints apply within UV-complete NP models:
%
high-\pt searches for signatures related to potential mediators of these transitions often provide strong constraints via, e.g., $b\bar{b} \to \tau\tau$~\cite{Faroughy:2016osc},   $b\bar{c} \to \tau\nu$~\cite{Greljo:2018tzh} or $h\to\tau\tau$~\cite{Feruglio:2018fxo}, while radiative corrections
%
can result in constraints from lepton universality in $\tau$ decays~\cite{Feruglio:2017rjo}, lepton-flavor violating decays~\cite{Feruglio:2017rjo}, charged-lepton magnetic moments~\cite{Feruglio:2018fxo} and electric dipole moments~\cite{Dekens:2018bci}. Current data on $\Upsilon(1S) \to \tau\tau$ decays also constrain most mediator models, and a future programme of measuring both $\Upsilon$ and $\psi$ decays can have sensitivity to all NP UV completions~\cite{Aloni:2017eny}. The current bounds on $b \to s \nu\bar{\nu}$, now only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ above the SM~\cite{Lees:2013kla,Grygier:2017tzo}, can also put severe constraints on particular NP models~\cite{Blake:2016olu,Cai:2017wry}. \Blu{Finally, it is interesting to note that contributions to $b\to s\ell\ell$ and $b\to s\gamma$ are also generically produced at loop level~\cite{Crivellin:2018yvo}.} 
%

At the HL/HE-LHC qualitative progress in identifying potential NP in $b\to c\tau\nu$ can be understood chiefly in terms of two classes of observables: 
%
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] Precision results for $R(X)$: $R(D^{(*)})$ can establish NP and give basic model differentiation. $R(\Lambda_c^{(*)})$ is a measurement with independent systematics that improves model discrimination since it is sensitive to a different combination of NP parameters. The same applies to inclusive $R(X_c)$, to be 
%
measured
by Belle~II. Other modes, like $R(D_s^{(*)})$ or $R(J/\psi)$, will add to these and provide cross-checks with independent systematic uncertainties.
%
\item[$\bullet$] Differential-rate measurements in $B\to X\tau\nu$: Differential measurements in $q^2$ as well as in the helicity angles and the $\tau$-polarization are powerful discriminators between the SM and NP, as well as between different NP models \cite{Korner:1987kd,Hagiwara:1989gza,Tanaka:1994ay,Chen:2005gr,Chen:2006nua,Nierste:2008qe,Tanaka:2010se,Fajfer:2012vx,Datta:2012qk,Sakaki:2012ft,Celis:2012dk,Duraisamy:2013kcw,Alonso:2016gym,Ligeti:2016npd,Celis:2016azn,Ivanov:2017mrj,Alonso:2017ktd,Jung:2018lfu}.
%
For instance, the low-recoil region in $B\to D\tau\nu$ is very sensitive to scalar contributions, tensor contributions change the polarization in the high-recoil region in $B\to D^*$ in a unique manner, and left-handed vector contributions leave normalized quantities unchanged while affecting the total rates sizably. Examples for the discriminating power of such measurements are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:projections} (right), where correlations in NP models are shown together with the first measurements of two proposed quantities by Belle~\cite{Hirose:2016wfn,Hirose:2017dxl}. First studies regarding the reach of LHCb for such observables are presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:bclnu:exp}. 
%
Already semi-integrated quantities like the forward-backward asymmetry or the observables shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:projections} can be very powerful in distinguishing different NP scenarios.
\end{itemize}

At high \pt, $b c \tau \nu$ operators can also be directly probed by the $pp \to \tau X$+MET (missing transverse energy) signature at the LHC, inclusively~\cite{Greljo:2018tzh}, or with a $b$-tag in the final state, with model discrimination possible at the beyond the $3\sigma$ level in at the HL-LHC~\cite{Altmannshofer:2017yso}. This channel would allow one to probe all the NP scenarios addressing the $R(D^{(*)})$ anomalies in the HL-LHC phase (see Sec.~\ref{sec:highpT}).  Analysis of NP effects in $b \to c \tau \nu$ will be made more powerful and self-consistent by the development of dedicated NP reweighting tools such as \texttt{Hammer}~\cite{Duell:2016maj}. These tools will permit experimental collaborations to efficiently reweight their very large simulated datasets to arbitrary NP models and thus fit for WCs as part of experimental analyses. 
%
Observation of NP in $b\to c\tau\nu$ would warrant precise measurements at HL-/HE-LHC of related modes, 
%
$b\to c (e,\mu)\nu$, $b\to u\tau\nu$ and $t\to b\tau\nu$ transitions.
