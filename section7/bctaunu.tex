\subsubsection{$B\rightarrow D^{(*)}l\nu$ Form factors and Anatomy of $R(D^{(*)})$}

Quite unexpectedly, signs of lepton flavor universality violation have not only been seen in loop-suppressed flavor-changing 
neutral currents discussed above, but also in tree-level decays, namely in tensions with the SM predictions for the ratios
\begin{equation}
  R(D^{(*)}) = \frac{\mathcal{B}(B \to D^{(*)}\tau\nu)}{\mathcal{B}(B \to D^{(*)}l\nu)},\,\hspace{0.5cm}(l=\mu,~e).
\end{equation}

Assuming for the moment only SM particle content, the $b\to c\ell\nu_{\ell^\prime}$ transitions at scales near $m_b$ can be described by a $SU(3) \times U(1)$-invariant effective Hamiltonian,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Heffbcellnu}
  \mathcal H_\text{eff}^{b\to c\tau\nu_{\ell}} = \frac{4 G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{cb}
    \sum_{\ell}\left(O_{V_L}^{\ell\ell} + \sum_{i,\ell'} C_i^{\ell\ell'} O_i^{\ell\ell'} + \text{h.c.}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\ell,\ell'=e,\mu,\tau$ denotes the charged lepton and neutrino flavor, respectively, and the sum over $i$ runs over the following operators:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ops}
\begin{split}
  O_{V_{L,R}}^{\ell\ell'} &= (\bar c_{L,R} \gamma^\mu b_{L,R})(\bar \ell_L \gamma_\mu \nu_{\ell' L}) \,, \\
  O_{S_{L,R}}^{\ell\ell'} &= (\bar c_{R,L} b_{L,R})(\bar \ell_R \nu_{\ell' L}) \,, \\
  O_T^{\ell\ell'} &= (\bar c_R \sigma^{\mu\nu} b_L)(\bar \ell_R \sigma_{\mu\nu}\nu_{\ell' L}) \,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with NP coefficients $C_i^{\ell\ell'}$ dependent on both charged-lepton and neutrino flavor in general. These operators arise from more fundamental interactions at a higher scale $\Lambda$ which, in accordance with available LHC data, can be taken to be larger than the electroweak scale $v˜$. The operators of Eq.~(\ref{eq:ops}) should then be embedded in ones consisting of fields with full SM gauge quantum numbers. For $C_{V_R}$ this is impossible at dimension-6, leading to a parametric suppression of at least $v^2/\Lambda^2$ for tree-level UV completions. Linearly realized electroweak symmetry breaking, captured by the \emph{Standard Model effective field theory} (SMEFT)~\cite{Buchmuller:1985jz,Grzadkowski:2010es}, also yields the prediction $C_{V_R}^{\ell\ell'} \equiv C_{V_R}\delta_{\ell\ell'}$~\cite{Cirigliano:2009wk,Cata:2015lta}, in which case sizable contributions to $C_{V_R}$ are excluded by $b\to c(e,\mu)\nu$~\cite{Jung:2018lfu}. While deviations from this prediction are possible in a non-linear realization of electroweak symmetry breaking~\cite{Cata:2015lta}, at least one of the above-named sources of suppression always remains and right-handed currents do not play a role.

The meson form factors stemming from the hadronic matrix elements of the SM operator $O_{V_L}^{\ell\ell}$ can be parametrized as~\cite{Caprini:1997mu}
\begin{align}
  \bra{D(v_D)} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu b \ket{\bar{B}(v_B)} &= h_+(w) (v_B + v_D)^\mu + h_-(w)(v_B - v_D)^\mu \,, \\
%
  \bra{D^*(v_{D^*}, \varepsilon_{D^*})} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu b \ket{\bar{B}(v_B)} &= 
	i h_V \varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} \varepsilon^*_{D^* \nu} v_{D^* \alpha} v_{B\, \beta} \,, \\
%
  \bra{D^*(v_{D^*}, \varepsilon_{D^*})} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 b \ket{\bar{B}(v_B)} &= 
	h_{A_1}(w) (w+1) \varepsilon^{*\, \mu}_{D^*} - 
	\left(h_{A_2}(w) v_B^\mu + h_{A_3}(w) v_{D^*}^\mu\right) \varepsilon_{D^*}^* \cdot v_B\,,
\end{align}
with form factors $h_i$, polarization vector $\varepsilon_{D^*}$, velocities $v_P$, and the dimensionless variable
$w = (m_B^2 + m_{D^{(*)}}^2-q^2)/(2 m_B m_{D^{(*)}})$. 
One can reformulate the above parametrization in terms of helicity amplitudes with definite parity and spin in the 
convention of Caprini, Lellouch, and Neubert (CLN) as~\cite{Caprini:1997mu}
\begin{multline}
  V_1 = h_+ - \frac{1-r}{1+r} h_-\,, \qquad
  S_1 = h_+ - \frac{1+r}{1-r} \frac{w-1}{w+1} h_-\,, \qquad
  V_4 = h_V, \qquad 
  A_1 = h_{A_1}\,, \\  
  A_5 = \frac{(w-r) h_{A_1} - (w-1) (r h_{A_2} + h_{A_3} )}{1-r}\,, \,
  P_1 = \frac{(w+1) h_{A_1} - (1 - w r) h_{A_2} - (w - r) h_{A_3} }{1+r} \,,
\end{multline}
where $r=m_{D^{(*)}}/m_B$.
The translation table to the form factor convention of Boyd, Grinstein, and Lebed (BGL) \cite{Boyd:1997kz} can be found in Ref.~\cite{Bigi:2017jbd}.
Using the helicity basis has the advantage that the unitarity bounds can be written in an elegant way. 
Employing the BGL parametrization \cite{Boyd:1997kz}
\begin{equation}
  F(z) = \frac{1}{P_F(z) \phi_F(z)} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n^F z^n, \qquad
  z = \frac{\sqrt{1+w}-\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1+w} + \sqrt{2}},
\end{equation} 
with Blaschke factor $P_F(z)$ and outer function $\phi_F(z)$, the unitarity bounds have the simple form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unitarity-constr}
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( a_n^F \right)^2 \leq 1\,,
\end{equation}
where \emph{e.g.}, the coefficients of $A_1$ and $A_5$ contribute to the same sum.
The contribution of the helicity form factors $S_1$ and $P_1$ to the branching ratios of $B\rightarrow Dl\nu$ and $B\rightarrow D^*l\nu$ are
suppressed by the mass of the final state lepton. In view of the lack of experimental information on these form factors we need  input from theory. 
In case of $B \to D$ we are in the fortunate position that lattice results
for both $V_1$ and $S_1$ at $w\geq 1$ exist~\cite{Lattice:2015rga,Na:2015kha,Aoki:2016frl}.
This is the reason for the very good agreement of all SM predictions in this case, see Table~\ref{tab:RD-and-RDstar-anomaly}.
For $B \to D^*$ we have only one data point from lattice, namely $A_1(w=1)$~\cite{Bailey:2014tva,Harrison:2017fmw}, so that it is necessary to use 
Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET)~\cite{Bernlochner:2017jka,Caprini:1997mu,Luke:1990eg,Neubert:1991xw,Neubert:1993mb,Neubert:1992wq,Neubert:1992pn,Ligeti:1993hw}
to relate the $B \to D$ and $B \to D^*$ form factors order-by-order in the heavy quark expansion in terms of Isgur--Wise functions,
in order to obtain a prediction for $P_1$ and hence $R(D^*)$. 

At NLO in the heavy quark expansion, \emph{i.e.}, expanding to linear order in $\alpha_s/\pi$ and $1/m_{c,b}$,
there is sufficient differential information in the $B \to D^{(*)}l\nu$ decays to fit to the four Isgur-Wise functions
that arise at this order \cite{Bernlochner:2017jka,Jaiswal:2017rve}. 
In the literature the theoretical error from using NLO HQET results is under discussion, leading to different 
results for the error of the SM prediction. 
HQET can also be used to obtain a stronger version of the unitarity bounds than Eq.~(\ref{eq:unitarity-constr}); 
see Refs.~\cite{Boyd:1997kz,Bigi:2017jbd} for details.
Additional model dependent theoretical input at maximal $w$ can be provided by Light Cone Sum Rules (LCSR)~\cite{Faller:2008tr},
or at zero recoil by QCD sum rules~\cite{Neubert:1992wq,Neubert:1992pn,Neubert:1993mb,Ligeti:1993hw}.
We give a summary of theoretical predictions for $R(D^{(*)})$ in Table~\ref{tab:RD-and-RDstar-anomaly}.

Because lattice data is presently available only at zero recoil for $B \to D^*$
and since kinematic suppression requires $d\Gamma[B \to D^*l\nu]/dw$ to vanish at $w=1$,  
$|V_{cb}|$ can be obtained from $B \to D^*l\nu$ only by extrapolating the slope of $d\Gamma[B \to D^*l\nu]/dw$,
fitted to $w > 1$ data, back to zero recoil. 
This procedure can be highly sensitive to the chosen form factor parameterization and other theoretical inputs;
for recent analyses see 
Refs.~\cite{Abdesselam:2017kjf,Bigi:2017njr,Bigi:2017jbd,Grinstein:2017nlq,Bernlochner:2017jka,Bernlochner:2017xyx,Jaiswal:2017rve,Harrison:2017fmw,Schacht:2017vfd}. 
Lattice data beyond zero recoil is expected soon (see \cite{Aviles-Casco:2017nge} for preliminary results),
from both domain wall and AsqTad ensemble approaches. 
Combined with abundant future data for $B \to D^*l\nu$ from HL-LHC, extractions of $|V_{cb}|$ that are less sensitive to theoretical inputs
will become possible, thereby either resolving or more concretely establishing tensions between exclusive and inclusive measurements of $|V_{cb}|$.

With future experimental data and lattice QCD results (see Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice} and Table~\ref{table:Proj} therein) the SM 
prediction of $R(D^*)$ will improve considerably. For an estimate, one may note that the dependence of $d\Gamma/dw$ on $P_1$ arises 
only incoherently, via a contribution of the form $m_l^2|P_1(w)|^2$. This $P_1$ term contributes approximately 10\% of the total 
integrated $B \to D^*\tau\nu$ rate, which suggests that the dependence of $R(D^*)$ on this form factor should be limited. 
Assuming a 1\% future precision for $P_1$, using the 50 ab$^{-1}$ which Belle~II will presumably gather by 2025, and taking into 
account the expected improvement of the form factors $A_{1,5}$ and $V_4$ from the lattice, it is hence reasonable to assume
an error of 0.001 for the SM value of $R(D^*)$ might be achieved.

\subsubsection{Excited states and other $b$ hadrons: $R(D^{**})$, $R(J/\psi)$ and $R(\Lambda_c)$}

Measurement of $|V_{cb}|$ and lepton universality can also be probed via $B$ decays to the $D^{**}$ excited states,
as well as decays of strange or charmed $b$ hadrons, including $B_s \to D^{(*)}_s$, $B_c \to J/\psi$,
and the baryonic $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c$ transitions. In comparison to the $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ decay modes, these modes may 
variously exhibit higher sensitivities to various operators of NP, or in some cases,
may be theoretically cleaner than the decays to the $D^{(*)}$ ground states. 
These modes can also be important downfeed or crossfeed backgrounds to the $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ decays and,
to the extent they are affected by the same NP operators, must also be understood and measured carefully.
The HL-LHC is the only planned experiment that will yield significant samples of these heavier $b$-hadrons, 
with precision analyses anticipated from the LHCb experiment.
In this subsection we present the motivations and theoretical prospects for the measurement of each of these decay modes.

The $D^{**}$ excited states comprise four different charmed hadrons: The $D_0^*$, $D_1^*$, $D_1$, $D_2^*$.
In the language of HQET, these furnish two doublets, $\{D_0^*\,,D_1^*\}$ and $\{D_1\,,D_2^*\}$,
with spin-parity $s_{\ell}^{\pi_\ell} = \frac{1}{2}^+$ and $\frac{3}{2}^+$, respectively.
(In the heavy quark limit, spin-parity is a conserved quantum number.)
The $\frac{3}{2}^+$ states are narrow, with $\Gamma \sim 30$--$50$\,MeV,
because their hadronic decays to $D^{(*)}\pi$ either proceed via a $d$-wave or violate heavy quark symmetry,
while the $\frac{1}{2}^+$ states are quite broad.  Although isolating these excited state decays will likely be simpler at $e^+e^-$ $B$ factories, 
which can more easily reconstruct $\pi^0$'s and photons, analyses of $B \to D^{**}\ell\nu$ decays are also feasible at HL-LHCb, 
especially for the narrow $\frac{3}{2}^+$ states subsequently decaying to charged hadrons.

The crucial attractive feature of the $B \to D^{**}$ transitions is that various leading order contributions to the form factors
vanish in the heavy quark limit at zero recoil ($w=1$), so that $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/m_{c,b})$ corrections
become important~\cite{Leibovich:1997tu,Leibovich:1997em,Bernlochner:2012bc,Bernlochner:2016bci}. 
The richer structure of the subleading form factor contributions has the consequence that sensitivity to various NP currents
can be much larger than in the ground state decays~\cite{Bernlochner:2016bci, Bernlochner:2017jxt}. 
For example, including only a NP tensor current, $C_T$, one finds the ratios
$R(X)/R(X)_{\text{SM}} \simeq \{1.5, 1.3\}$ for $X = \{D, D^*\}$ at the best fit to the $R(D^{(*)})$ data. 
However, the same Wilson coefficients result in $R(X)/R(X)_{\text{SM}}$ greater than $4.0$ or less than $0.5$ for $X=\{D_0^*, D_1^*, D_1, D_2^*\}$.
The current SM predictions for all four modes, from fits to Belle data including NLO HQET contributions, are~\cite{Bernlochner:2017jxt}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:RDDs}
  R(D_0^*) &= 0.08 \pm 0.03\,, & R(D_1^*) &= 0.05 \pm 0.02\,, \nonumber \\*
  R(D_1) &=  0.10 \pm 0.02\,, & R(D_2^*) &= 0.07 \pm 0.01\,.
\end{align}

Decays of $B$ mesons to these excited states have total SM branching ratios comparable to the $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ decays themselves.
Combined with the possible large enhancement of the semitauonic modes by NP contributions,
this means that the subsequent $D^{**} \to D^{(*)}X$ decays can then induce important downfeed  backgrounds to the $D^{(*)}$ measurements.
Analyses of $B \to D^{(*)}\ell \nu$ typically will therefore have to fold in contributions from these excited states.
Moreover, anticipated analyses for the inclusive $B \to D\pi\ell\nu$ decays provide an opportunity to probe these excited state decays,
and their associated larger NP sensitivities, \emph{collectively} with the ground state decays:
in this context, rather than being thought of as a background, these contributions should be more properly thought of as additional sources of (NP) signal.
The large data sets from HL-LHC will then provide a very sensitive set of channels for probing NP contributions to $b \to c \ell \nu$. {\bf \color{red}[Check!]}

The $B_s$ and $B_c$ mesons have production ratios $\sigma(B_s)/\sigma(b\bar{b}) \sim 10\%$~\cite{Aaij:2013noa}
and $\sigma(B_c)/\sigma(b\bar{b}) \sim 0.2\%$~\cite{Aaij:2013cda} from Run 1 LHC data.
A much smaller sample of $B_s$ mesons may also be produced at $B$ factories running on the $\Upsilon(5S)$ resonance.
However, for the $B_c$ the only significant sample of mesons will be produced at HL-LHC.

At first glance, the theoretical structure of $B_s \to D_s^{(*,**)}\ell\nu$ can be mapped directly from $B \to D^{(*,**)}\ell\nu$
via the approximate $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry.
Some crucial differences are that $\mathcal{B}(D_s^{*} \to D_s\gamma) \simeq 94\%$, which will be difficult to see at HL-LHCb,
while the four $D_s^{**}$ excited states are all narrow, and therefore may be easier to resolve.

The leptonic $B_c \to (J/\psi \to \mu\mu) \ell \nu$ decay mode is reasonably experimentally clean with measurements for $R(J/\psi)$ already available from LHCb Run 1 data~\cite{Aaij:2017tyk},
\begin{equation}
  R(J/\psi) = 0.71 \pm 0.17\,\text{(stat)}\, \pm 0.18\,\text{(sys)} \,,
\end{equation}
albeit with large uncertainties at present. A central difficulty in probing this mode lies in the large theoretical uncertainties for the $B_c \to J/\psi$ form factor parameterizations. Predictions for the form factors are typically hadronic-model-dependent, making use of either perturbative QCD, the constituent quark model, the (non)relativitistic quark model, or QCD sum rules~\cite{Anisimov:1998uk,Kiselev:1999sc,Ivanov:2000aj,Kiselev:2002vz,Hernandez:2006gt,Ivanov:2006ni,Wen-Fei:2013uea,Qiao:2012vt,Rui:2016opu}. The recent LHCb results have motivated several more recent studies of the form factors~\cite{Dutta:2017xmj,Tran:2018kuv,Issadykov:2018myx,Watanabe:2017mip}. A recent, more model-independent result combines preliminary lattice QCD results with dispersive bounds and zero-recoil heavy-quark relations, leading to the prediction~\cite{Cohen:2018dgz}
\begin{equation}
  0.20 \le R(J/\psi) \le 0.39
\end{equation}
at $95\%$ CL, implying a mild tension at the $1.3\sigma$ level with the data.

Abundant samples of $\Lambda_b$'s will be produced only at (HL-)LHC, with a production cross-section $\sigma(\Lambda_b)/\sigma(b\bar{b}) \sim 10\%$~\cite{Aaij:2011jp}. 
From an HQET point of view, the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c$ transitions are theoretically cleaner than the $B \to D^{(*)}$ decays,
because the ``brown muck'' dressing the heavy quark lies in the $s_{\ell}^{\pi_\ell}= 0^+$ ground state.
A consequence of this is a relatively simpler form factor structure where not only the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$
but also the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_{c,b})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s/m_{c,b})$ subleading contributions
are fully fixed by the leading order HQET structure, reducing the number of free parameters in the form factor fits.
These modes are therefore promising, clean candidates for testing the behavior of the HQET expansion itself,
by \emph{e.g.}, assessing the impact of $\mathcal{O}(1/m_c^2)$ contributions.
Fitting the subsubleading $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s, \alpha_s/m_{c,b}, 1/m_c^2)$ HQET structure to existing LHCb data~\cite{Aaij:2017svr}
and lattice form factor results~\cite{Detmold:2015aaa} implies such terms are of the expected size~\cite{Bernlochner:2018kxh}.
More $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \ell \nu$ data from LHCb will improve the precision of these results, allowing access to other subleading terms.
Moreover, with precision lattice calculations of the form factors (see \emph{e.g.}, Ref.~\cite{Detmold:2015aaa}), additional data for these modes may permit precision measurement of $|V_{cb}|$ in an environment with reduced theoretical uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Models of NP for $b\to c\tau\nu$}
{\bf\color{red}[Move this to the end of the section?]}\\

The first thing to note in a discussion of a possible NP origin of the deviations in $R(D^{(*)})$ is that such a NP contribution has to be large: Defining $\hat{R}(X)=R(X)/R(X)|_{\rm SM}$, we have with present data $\hat{R}(D)=1.36 \pm 0.15$ and $\hat{R}(D^*)=1.19 \pm 0.06$. This points to a NP contribution to the amplitude $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the SM for deviations driven by NP and SM interfering and $\gtrsim 40\%$ without interference. As a consequence, NP is expected to contribute at tree level, for which possible mediators involving only SM fields have been classified in~\cite{Freytsis:2015qca}. If the present central value of the deviation is sustained, another implication is that this anomaly will be established by the time of measurements at HL/HE-LHC, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:projections} on the left. The focus will hence shift to model differentiation in $b\to c\tau\nu$ and the analysis of the lepton- and quark-flavor structure of the NP contributions. In any case, precision measurements in $b\to c\tau\nu$ discussed here will provide the strictest direct limits on flavor-non-universality in these transitions and hence remain valuable constraints on NP models. A completely general NP analysis will require theoretical care. For instance, form factor determinations from $b\to c$ semileptonic decays with light leptons in the final state could also be sensitive to NP contributions, subject to the constraint that extractions of $|V_{cb}|$ from the selfsame decays can be made consistent with all other global data on CKM unitarity. Consequently, form factor parameters determined experimentally in these modes may require a simultaneous fit to the deviations themselves or additional determinations of form factor ratios, which, however, are expected to be available at the required precision by the start of HL/HE-LHC. See Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice} for corresponding prospects from lattice QCD.

Classifying models accommodating the anomalies according to tree-level mediator and to the contribution they give in terms of the effective operators in eq.~(\ref{eq:Heffbcellnu}), the options are a $W'$~\cite{Greljo:2015mma,Boucenna:2016wpr,Boucenna:2016qad,Megias:2017ove}, generating $C_{V_L}$, a charged color-neutral scalar~\cite{Crivellin:2012ye,Celis:2012dk,Crivellin:2015hha,Celis:2016azn,Chen:2017eby,Iguro:2017ysu,Chen:2018hqy,Li:2018rax}, generating $C_{S_{L,R}}$, and leptoquarks~\cite{Fajfer:2012jt,Deshpande:2012rr,Sakaki:2013bfa,Duraisamy:2014sna,Calibbi:2015kma,Fajfer:2015ycq,Barbieri:2015yvd,Alonso:2015sja,Bauer:2015knc,Das:2016vkr,Deshpand:2016cpw,Sahoo:2016pet,Dumont:2016xpj,Li:2016vvp,Becirevic:2016yqi,Barbieri:2016las,DiLuzio:2017vat,Chen:2017hir,Bordone:2017bld,Altmannshofer:2017poe,Becirevic:2018afm}, generating various couplings, mostly $C_{V_L}$ or $C_{S_L} \sim C_T$. For comparisons between these models,  see for instance~\cite{Tanaka:2012nw,Freytsis:2015qca,Bhattacharya:2016zcw,Ivanov:2017mrj,Alok:2017qsi,Bifani:2018zmi}.
Allowing for additional light particles opens up the possibility to address the anomalies with contributions involving right-handed neutrinos~\cite{He:2012zp,He:2017bft,Greljo:2018ogz,Asadi:2018wea,Robinson:2018gza,Azatov:2018kzb,Heeck:2018ntp}, since the neutrino is not detected. 

The large number of possibilities reflects the fact that models typically introduce at least 2 degrees of freedom (one complex coupling), which mostly allows to address $R(D^{(*)})$.\footnote{Models generating only $C_{V_L}$ effectively introduce only one degree of freedom, since they amount to rescaling $V_{cb}$ in the modes involving $\tau$; hence this class of models implies universal $\hat R(X)$ ratios, specifically $\hat R(D)=\hat R(D^*)$.} In order to differentiate between these models, a precise determination of $R(D^{(*)})$ can therefore only be a first step. Presently, available additional observables constraining directly $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions are the following: (a) Differential distributions in $q^2$~\cite{Lees:2013uzd,Huschle:2015rga}, already excluding some fine-tuned scenarios despite their large uncertainties. (b) First measurements of the $\tau$ polarization asymmetry and the longitudinal fraction in $B\to D^*\tau\nu$~\cite{Hirose:2016wfn,Hirose:2017dxl}. (c) The measurement of $R(J/\psi)$~\cite{Aaij:2017tyk}, which is up to $2\sigma$ above the SM prediction, as well as that of any NP model, for which see the previous subsection. (d) The measurement of the inclusive rate $b\to X\tau\nu$ at LEP~\cite{Abbaneo:2001bv}, yielding $\hat R_b(X_c)=0.99\pm0.10$, in slight tension with the measurements for $R(D^{(*)})$~\cite{Ligeti:2014kia,Freytsis:2015qca,Celis:2016azn,Mannel:2017jfk}. (e) The (indirect) bound on $B_c \to \tau\nu$ from the $B_c$ lifetime~\cite{Li:2016vvp,Alonso:2016oyd,Akeroyd:2017mhr}, providing a strong constraint on models with only scalar couplings and disfavoring them as a solution for $R(D^*)$ for values close to the present central value.

Additional indirect constraints apply when trying to formulate actual models, as opposed to only considering effective couplings at the scale of $m_b$: high-$p_T$ searches for signatures related to potential mediators of these transitions often provide strong constraints via, \emph{e.g.}, $b\bar{b} \to \tau\tau$ or $h\to\tau\tau$~\cite{Faroughy:2016osc,Feruglio:2018fxo}, and the renormalization-group evolution of the relevant operators from the mediator scale down to the $b$ scale can induce constraints from lepton-universality in $\tau$ decays~\cite{Feruglio:2017rjo}, lepton-flavor violating decays~\cite{Feruglio:2017rjo}, charged-lepton magnetic moments~\cite{Feruglio:2018fxo} and electric dipole moments in models with non-vanishing imaginary parts~\cite{Dekens:2018bci}. Current data on $\Upsilon(1S) \to \tau\tau$ decays also constrains most mediator models, and a future program of measuring both $\Upsilon$ and $\psi$ decays can have sensitivity to all completions~\cite{Aloni:2017eny}. The current bounds on $b \to s \nu\bar{\nu}$, now only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ above the SM~\cite{Lees:2013kla,Grygier:2017tzo}, can also be severe constraints on particular models~\cite{Blake:2016olu}, although their interpretation is more model-dependent, being sensitive to assumptions on both mediator and specific flavor structure of couplings.

At the HL/HE-LHC qualitative progress in identifying potential NP in $b\to c\tau\nu$ can be understood chiefly in terms of two classes of observables arising from analyses of the data:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[\bullet] Precision results for $R(X)$: $R(D^{(*)})$ are used for establishing NP in these modes, as well as basic model differentiation. $R(\Lambda_c)$, as discussed in the last subsection, is sensitive to a different combination of NP parameters and hence provides a measurement with independent systematics as well as improved model discrimination. The same is true for the inclusive measurement $R(X_c)$, which, however, is expected to be measured at Belle~(II) only. Other modes, like $R(D_s^{(*)})$ or $R(J/\psi)$ will add to these and provide cross-checks with independent systematic uncertainties; however, $R(D_s)$ is expected to have very similar NP dependence as $R(D)$, while $R(D_s^*)$ and (less so) $R(J/\psi)$ constrain similar combinations as $R(D^*)$, hence their model-differentiating power is limited. 
\item[\bullet] Differential-rate measurements in $B\to X\tau\nu$: Differential measurements in $q^2$ as well as in the helicity angles and the $\tau$-polarization are powerful discriminators between the SM and NP, as well as between different NP models \cite{Korner:1987kd,Hagiwara:1989gza,Tanaka:1994ay,Chen:2005gr,Chen:2006nua,Nierste:2008qe,Tanaka:2010se,Fajfer:2012vx,Datta:2012qk,Sakaki:2012ft,Celis:2012dk,Duraisamy:2013kcw,Alonso:2016gym,Ligeti:2016npd,Celis:2016azn,Ivanov:2017mrj,Alonso:2017ktd,Jung:2018lfu}.
The different dependence on kinematic variables allows for optimized searches for specific NP contributions. For instance, the low-recoil region in $B\to D\tau\nu$ is very sensitive to scalar contributions, tensor contributions change the polarization in the high-recoil region in $B\to D^*$ in a unique manner and left-handed vector contributions leave normalized quantities unchanged while affecting the total rates sizably. Examples for the discriminating power of such measurements are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:projections} on the right, where correlations in NP models are shown together with the first measurements of two proposed quantities by Belle~\cite{Hirose:2016wfn,Hirose:2017dxl}. First studies regarding the reach of LHCb for such observables are presented in the following subsection. These measurements are highly nontrivial, given the missing neutrinos and the fact that so far for instance the expected $q^2$ distribution has been used in the measurements of $R(D^*)$ for background suppression. However, already semi-integrated quantities like the forward-backward asymmetry or the observables shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:projections} can be very powerful in distinguishing different NP scenarios.
\end{itemize}

At high-$p_T$, the $b c \tau \nu$ operator can also be directly probed in the $pp \to b\tau + \slashed{E}_T$ final state, with model discrimination possible at the beyond the $3\sigma$ level in at the HL-LHC~\cite{Altmannshofer:2017yso} (see Sec.~\ref{sec:highpT}). {\bf\color{red}[Update! (Jorge)]} Analysis of NP in $b \to c \tau \nu$ will be made more powerful and self-consistent by the development of dedicated NP reweighting tools such as \texttt{Hammer}~\cite{Duell:2016maj}. These tools will permit experimental collaborations to efficiently reweight their very large simulated datasets to arbitrary NP models. NP analyses can then be performed directly on their $b \to c \tau \nu$ data, fitting the full differential space of the decay cascades to arbitrary NP models and simultaneously floating against backgrounds to obtain self-consistent results for best-fit NP Wilson coefficients, including possible NP contributions in the light lepton modes.


Observation of NP in $b\to c\tau\nu$ would warrant an analysis of its flavor structure, \emph{e.g.}, in $b\to c (e,\mu)\nu$, $b\to u\tau\nu$ and $t\to b\tau\nu$ transitions. While these are not a focus here, it is worth emphasizing that the HL/HE-LHC will be a powerful instrument to analyze these modes.
