\section{Bottom quark probes of new physics and prospects for $B$-anomalies \label{secBanom}}


A key contribution of the HL-LHC datasets will be a comprehensive global picture of rare and (semi)-leptonic quark transitions. This has value whether or not the current ``flavour anomalies'' are confirmed with Run~2 or Run~3 LHC data. If the modes which are most statistically sensitive ($R_{K}$ and \RDb) confirm the anomalies, a  global analysis of all analogous channels will provide a way to discriminate between the full range of possible BSM explanations. Such a global analysis will also help to pin down the mass scale of the BSM particles and mediators, which, together with the direct HL-LHC searches, will further restrict the range of possible explanations for the anomalies. On the other hand, if the anomalies decrease in significance with Run~2 and Run~3 data (or disappear), we may return to searching for small BSM
effects on top of the dominant SM amplitudes. In this case, global analyses of the data would lead to improved bounds on the BSM affecting these flavor observables. The statistical power of the HL-LHC datasets will also enable a unique reach for singular BSM signatures such as LFV and BNV searches, particularly in the baryon and heavy meson sectors.

We would like to stress that, in the HL-LHC era, many rare beauty decays will become abundant and enter precision measurement regime. It will therefore become increasingly important that the HL-LHC collaborations, and Belle II, publish results in such a way that systematic uncertainties can be treated in coherent manner and their correlations understood. 
A good example of this is the treatment of the ratio of
hadronization fractions $f_s/f_d$ in any LHC $B_q\to \ell\ell$ combination, as discussed further in Sec.~\ref{sec:7_exp}. It will also be important to correctly treat systematic uncertainties arising from the use of common software packages, e.g. the use of PHOTOS by the HL-LHC experiments and Belle~II in future lepton universality measurements.

While much of the power of the HL-LHC and Belle~II datasets will lie in the breadth of precisely measured rare and (semi)-leptonic decays, practical considerations mean that experiments will continue to publish analyses of individual decay modes as each is completed. It will therefore be particularly important to provide these results in a way which facilitates both the combination of results between experimental collaborations, and the inclusion of these results in global fits and tests of phenomenological models~\cite{Hurth:2017sqw,Blake:2017fyh,Chrzaszcz:2018yza}. 
Systematically publishing experimental likelihoods, efficiency maps, and resolution unfoldings, as already done for some of the most important analyses, should therefore be strongly encouraged.
