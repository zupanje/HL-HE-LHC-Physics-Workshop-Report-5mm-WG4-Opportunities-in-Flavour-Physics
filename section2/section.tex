\section{Testing the CKM unitarity}
{\it \small Author(s) (TH): J\'er\^ome Charles, Marco Ciuchini,  Olivier Deschamps, S\'ebastien Descotes-Genon, Luca Silvestrini, Vincenzo Vagnoni.}
\label{sec:metro-CKM}

In the SM, the weak charged-current transitions mix quarks of different generations, which is encoded in the
unitary Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix~\cite{Cabibbo:1963yz,Kobayashi:1973fv}.
The SM does not predict the values of the weak flavour-couplings, and so all matrix elements must be measured experimentally.
However, the unitary nature of the CKM matrix, and the assumptions of the SM, impose relations between the elements that are
often expressed graphically in the complex plane as the so-called unitarity triangle.
Overconstraining the apex of this unitarity triangle from tree- and loop-level quark mixing processes is therefore a powerful way to probe for virtual BSM effects at mass scales complementary or superior to those which can be directly searched for at the HL-LHC. As we shall see below, such indirect probes of BSM physics will not be limited by either experimental or theoretical systematics in the HL-LHC era.

\subsection{Structure of the CKM matrix}

%\subsubsection{The CKM parameters}
% S. Descotes-Genon

 The part of the SM 
 Lagrangian which is relevant for describing quark mixing is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chargeInteraction}
\mathcal{L}_{W^{\pm}} = -
\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\left(V_{\rm
CKM} \right )_{ij}  \big(\overline{u}_{i}\gamma^{\mu}\tfrac{(1-\gamma_5)}{2}d_{j}\big) W_{\mu}^{+} + \mathrm{h.c.},
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the electroweak coupling constant, and $V_{\rm
CKM}$ the unitary CKM matrix,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ckmMatrix}
V_{\rm CKM} = \left(
\begin{array}{lcr}
V_{ud} & V_{us} & V_{ub} \\
V_{cd} & V_{cs} & V_{cb} \\
V_{td} & V_{ts} & V_{tb}
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
The CKM matrix induces flavour-changing transitions inside and between generations in the charged currents at tree level ($W^\pm$ interaction). By contrast, there are no flavour-changing transitions in the neutral currents at tree level.

Experimentally, a strong hierarchy is observed  among the CKM matrix elements: transitions within the same generation are characterised by $V_{\rm CKM}$ elements of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, whereas
there is a suppression of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$
between 1st and 2nd generations, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ between 2nd and 3rd and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ between 1st and 3rd.
This hierarchy is expressed by defining the four phase convention--independent
quantities,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lambda:A:rhoeta}
\lambda^2 =\frac{|V_{us}|^2}{|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{us}|^2}\,, \qquad
A^2\lambda^4=\frac{|V_{cb}|^2}{|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{us}|^2}\,, \qquad
\bar\rho+i\bar\eta=-\frac{V_{ud}V_{ub}^*}{V_{cd}V^*_{cb}}.
\end{equation}
The four independent quantities, $\lambda$, $A$, $\bar \rho$, $\bar \eta$,  fully determine the CKM matrix in the SM.

The CKM matrix can be expanded in powers of the small parameter
$\lambda$ (which corresponds to the Cabibbo parameter $\sin{\theta_{C}}\simeq
0.22$)~\cite{Wolfenstein:1983yz} by exploiting the unitarity of
$V_\text{CKM}$. This
expansion yields the following parametrisation, valid up to
$\mathcal{O}\big(\lambda^{6}\big)$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ckmWolfenstein4}
V_{\rm CKM} = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{2}-\frac{1}{8}\lambda^{4} & \lambda & A\lambda^{3}\left(\bar\rho -i\bar\eta\right) \\
-\lambda +\frac{1}{2}A^{2}\lambda^{5}\left[1-2(\bar\rho +i\bar\eta)\right] & 1-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{2}-\frac{1}{8}\lambda^{4}(1+4A^{2}) & A\lambda^{2} \\
A\lambda^{3}\left[1-(\bar\rho +i\bar\eta)\right]~ &
~-A\lambda^{2}+\frac{1}{2}A\lambda^{4}\left[1-2(\bar\rho
+i\bar\eta)\right]~ & ~1-\frac{1}{2}A^{2}\lambda^{4}
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
The CKM matrix is complex, i.e., it contains a phase that cannot be rotated away, if $\bar\eta\ne 0$.  Furthermore, \CP is violated,  if
and only if $\bar\eta$ differs from zero. 
%To lowest order, the Jarlskog parameter measuring \CP violation in a convention-independent manner~\cite{Jarlskog:1985ht},
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:jarlskogValueWolf}
%J_{C\!P} \equiv \left|\Im\left(V_{i\alpha} V_{j\beta}
%V_{i\beta}^{*}V_{j\alpha}^{*}\right)\right| =
%\lambda^{6}A^{2}\bar\eta, \qquad \left( i\neq j,
%\alpha\neq\beta\right),
%\end{equation}
%is directly related to the \CP-violating parameter $\bar\eta$.

Orthogonality relations can be written involving two columns or two rows of the unitary CKM matrix, and they can be represented as triangles in the complex plane. It is standard to focus on the following orthogonality relation,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:orthog:rel}
{V_{ud}V_{ub}^{*}}+{V_{cd}V_{cb}^{*}}+{V_{td}V_{tb}^{*}} = 0,
\end{equation}
as the three products of CKM elements 
%are involved in $B$-meson weak decays 
are of similar size, ${\mathcal O}(\lambda^3)$. Fig.~\ref{fig:UTtriangle} shows the standard unitarity triangle (UT), obtained from Eq.~\eqref{eq:orthog:rel} by rescaling the three terms in the orthogonality relation by $V_{cd}V_{cb}^{*}$. 
%with apices located at $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$ and $(\bar\rho,\bar\eta)$. 
The apex of the UT is at $(\bar\rho,\bar\eta)$, while 
the angles 
%of the
%UT 
are related to the CKM matrix elements as
\begin{equation}
\alpha= \arg{\left(-\frac{V_{td}V_{tb}^{*}}{V_{ud}V_{ub}^{*}}\right)}, \qquad
\beta=\arg{\left(-\frac{V_{cd}V_{cb}^{*}}{V_{td}V_{tb}^{*}}\right)}, \qquad
\gamma\equiv\arg{\left(-\frac{V_{ud}V_{ub}^{*}}{V_{cd}V_{cb}^{*}}\right)}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Current status of the constraints}

%\td{1/2 page for each constraint}

\subsubsection{$|V_{ud}|,|V_{us}|,|V_{cd}|,|V_{cs}|$}
% S. Descotes-Genon

Accurate constraints on the first and second rows and columns of the CKM matrix come from leptonic decays, $\pi\to e\nu$, $K\to e\nu$, $K\to\mu\nu$, $\tau\to \pi\nu_\tau$,  $\tau\to K\nu_\tau$, $D\to \mu\nu$, $D_s\to \mu\nu$, and from semileptonic decays, $K\to\pi e\nu$, $D\to \pi e\nu$, $D_s\to Ke\nu$. The extraction of CKM matrix elements requires knowledge of hadronic inputs (decay constants for the leptonic decays, normalisations of the form factors at $q^2=0$ for the semileptonic decays) and electromagnetic/isospin corrections when available (i.e., for kaon and pion decays)~\cite{Antonelli:2010yf}. Another prominent input for $|V_{ud}|$ determination comes from the consideration of the superallowed $\beta$ decays of 20 different nuclei~\cite{Hardy:2014qxa,Towner:2015woa,Hardy:2018zsb}, which provides a very accurate constraint on $|V_{ud}|$. There are also other constraints, but less powerful due to experimental uncertainties and/or theoretical systematics that are difficult to assess.


\subsubsection{$|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$} 
% M. Ciuchini and L. Silvestrini

Tree-level semileptonic decays of beauty mesons and baryons allow for the extraction of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$. The current determination is dominated by the $B$-factories data on $B$ decays and by the measurement of $|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|$ from baryonic decays at LHCb. For $B$ decays, both inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays have been used to extract $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$. The two approaches have different sources of theoretical uncertainties: inclusive analyses rely on quark-hadron duality, on the heavy quark expansion and, for $|V_{ub}|$, on additional modeling; exclusive analyses require the knowledge of the relevant form factors over the entire kinematic range, a very difficult task for lattice QCD. Currently, the HFLAV averages for inclusive and exclusive determinations of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ disagree at the $3\sigma$ level.
While recently the choice of the parameterization of the form factor dependence on the recoil for $B \to D^*$ decays has been shown to have a large impact on the extracted value of $|V_{cb}|$ \cite{Abdesselam:2018nnh,Bigi:2017njr,Grinstein:2017nlq}, the situation is still rather unclear. 

One way to deal with this, followed by the UTFit collaboration, is to assume that the uncertainty of each determination of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ might have been underestimated, and perform a "skeptic combination" of all available data following the method of Ref.~\cite{DAgostini:1999niu}, which is equivalent to the PDG prescription in one dimension, and is a straightforward generalization to the two-dimensional case of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$. The result 
%of this exercise
 is reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:UTfitvubvcb}, where in addition to the average we also plot the "indirect determination" obtained from all the other flavour observables.
 % in the SM. 
 The numerical results of the skeptic average are $|V_{cb}| = 0.0405 \pm 0.0011$, $|V_{ub}| = 0.00374 \pm 0.00023$, with correlation $\rho = 0.09$. CKMfitter collaboration uses instead the exclusive value for $V_{cb}$ from $B\to D^* \ell \nu$  that was obtained using more model independent BGL parametrisation, and which is in agreement with both $B\to D \ell \nu$  and the inclusive extraction. This leads to the combined value $|V_{cb}|=(41.8\pm0.4({\rm exp})\pm0.6({\rm theory}))\cdot 10^{-3}$. For $V_{ub}$ the CKMfitter collaboration performs an R-fit of inclusive and exclusive determinations to obtain $|V_{ub}|=(3.98\pm0.08({\rm exp})\pm0.22({\rm LQCD}))\cdot 10^{-3}$.

\begin{figure}[!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{section2/figures/VubVcb_winter18.pdf} 
\caption{
Measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ from exclusive and inclusive $B$ decays (vertical and horizontal bands) and from \PMuNu and \LcMuNu (diagonal band), skeptical average and indirect determination of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$.
}
\label{fig:UTfitvubvcb}
\end{figure} 

It is reasonable to expect that progress on the lattice QCD determination of form factors in a larger kinematic range will allow Belle II to perform a much more parameterization-independent extraction of $V_{cb}$ from exclusive decays, hopefully reconciling it with the inclusive one. Also for $V_{ub}$, the much larger statistics should allow to get an insight on the origin of the discrepancy between inclusive and exclusive determinations, and provide a consistent determination of $V_{ub}$. 

\subsubsection{Angle $\alpha$}

% O. Deschamps
The constraints on the CKM angle $\alpha$ are derived from the isospin analysis of the charmless decay modes $B\to\pi\pi$, $B\to\rho\rho$ and $B\to\rho\pi$. This approach has the  interesting feature of being almost free from hadronic uncertainties. Assuming isospin symmetry and neglecting the electroweak penguin contributions, the amplitudes of the isospin $SU(2)$-conjugated modes are related. The measured branching fractions and asymmetries in the $\B^{\pm,0}\to(\pi\pi)^{\pm,0}$ and $B^{\pm,0}\to(\rho\rho)^{\pm,0}$ modes and the bilinear form factors in the Dalitz analysis of the neutral $B^{0}\to(\rho\pi)^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ decays thus provide enough observables to simultaneously extract the weak phase $\beta+\gamma=\pi-\alpha$ together with the hadronic tree and penguin contribution to each mode. The combination of the experimental data for the three decay modes above, mostly provided by the $B$-factories,  gives the world-average value at 68\% 
Confidence  Level (CL)\cite{Charles:2017evz}: 
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:alphadir}
$\alpha_{\rm dir} = (86.2^{+4.4}_{-4.0} \xspace\cup\xspace 178.4^{+3.9}_{-5.1})^\circ\,$.
%\end{equation}
The experimental uncertainty is so far significantly larger than the theoretical uncertainty 
%related to hypotheses underlying the 
due to isospin $SU(2)$ breaking, which
%analysis that 
may affect the  $\alpha_{\rm dir}$ determination at around $2^\circ$. The solution near $90^\circ$ is in  good agreement with the indirect determination obtained by the global fit of the flavour data\cite{CKMfitterwebsite}.
%\begin{equation}
%\alpha_{\rm ind}  = \val{92.5}{+1.5}{-1.1}{$^\circ$}\,.\label{eq:alphaInd}
%\end{equation}
% Considered separately, the $B\to\pi\pi$ and $B\to\rho\rho$ decays yield direct determinations of $\alpha$ in very good agreement with the indirect determination Eq.~(\ref{eq:alphaInd}), whereas the $B\to \rho\pi$ decay exhibits a 3$\sigma$ discrepancy. This discrepancy affects only marginally the combination Eq.~(\ref{eq:alphadir}), which is dominated by the results from $\rho\rho$ decays, and to a lesser extent $\pi\pi$ decays, whereas $\rho\pi$ modes play only a limited role.\\


A detailed analysis of the prospects for the CKM angle $\alpha$ has been performed in~\cite{Charles:2017evz}.
%, evaluating the individual impact of the charmless decay observables on the $\alpha$ determination. 
The global
%of the  decay-specific determinations of 
determination of $\alpha$ is dominated by the $B\to\rho\rho$ data,
% that provides a constraint with a relative uncertainty at the level of 
constraining $\alpha$ with about 5\% uncertainty.  Improving the measurements of the neutral modes, especially the colour-suppressed $B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0$ decay, can have  sizeable impact. In the $B\to\pi\pi$ system any sizable improvement is  driven by the increased accuracy in the measurement of the direct $\CP$ asymmetry in the colour-suppressed decay  $B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$, potentially reachable through Dalitz decays $\pi^0\to\gamma e^+e^-$. However, all $\alpha$ measurements at subdegree precision must address isospin-breaking effects such as electroweak penguin contributions~\cite{Charles:2017evz,Gronau:2005pq}.

%\td{should this be moved to the experimental prospects?:}
%The experimental data is so far statistically limited for all the considered charmless modes. Due to the limited reconstruction efficiency of the neutral pions and the large associated background in the hadronic environment, the LHC contribution to the isospin analyses is so far confined to the final states reconstructed from charged pions only, i.e., the measurement of the branching ratio and the time-dependent $CP$-asymmetries in the  $B^0\to\pi^+\pi^-$ decay\cite{Aaij:2012as,Aaij:2018tfw}, and the branching ratio and fraction of longitudinal polarisation in the colour-suppressed decay mode, $B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0$ \cite{Aaij:2015ria}. A detailed analysis of the prospects for the CKM angle $\alpha$ has been performed in~\cite{Charles:2017evz}, evaluating the individual impact of the charmless decay observables on the $\alpha$ determination.

%The global combination of the  decay-specific determinations of $\alpha$ is dominated by the $B\to\rho\rho$ data,
%% that provides a constraint with a relative uncertainty at the level of 
%constraining $\alpha$ with about 5\% uncertainty.  Improving the accuracy of the $B^+\to\rho^+\rho^0$ branching ratio would  only marginally improve the determination of $\alpha$ (keeping all other observables unchanged). Improving the measurements of the neutral modes, especially the colour-suppressed $B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0$ decay, has larger impact,  driven by the $\CP$-asymmetries parameters.

%The subleading contribution to the combined $\alpha$ determination is provided by the $B\to\pi\pi$ system. Any sizable improvement on $\alpha_{\pi\pi}$ is  driven by the increased accuracy in the measurement of the direct $\CP$ asymmetry in the colour-suppressed decay  $B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$. No time-dependent analysis has become available so far for the colour-suppressed mode due to the dominant di-photon decay of the neutral pions that  hinders the measurement of the decay time. However, the Dalitz decay $\pi^0\to\gamma e^+e^-$ (with low branching fraction) or the photon conversion in the detector material may allow one to measure the $B^0$ decay time in the future high-statistics flavour experiments.  In addition to a significant improvement on $\alpha$, the measurement of  $S^{00}_{\pi\pi}$ would  lift some of the discrete ambiguities and thus reduce the number of mirror solutions in the $B\to\pi\pi$ isospin analysis.

%The extraction of  $\alpha$ in the $B^0\to(\rho\pi)^0$ system relies on the analysis of the interference between the quasi two-body modes $B^0\to\rho^+\pi^-$, $B^0\to\rho^-\pi^+$ and  $B^0\to\rho^0\pi^0$. The Dalitz analysis of the three-pions final states permits a determination free from the discrete ambiguities usually affecting the (quasi) two-body modes, $B\to\rho\rho$ and $B\to\pi\pi$ . In addition, studies of the \decay{\Bp}{\pip\pip\pim} decay can provide useful constraints on the resonant structure of the decay, minimizing associated systematic uncertainties~\cite{Tandean:2002pe}.
%However, all $\alpha$ measurements at subdegree precision must address isospin-breaking effects such as electroweak penguin contributions~\cite{Charles:2017evz,Gronau:2005pq}.
%At LHCb, such analysis has to face the two fold difficulty of reconstructing the soft $\pi^0$ in the $\rho^+\pi^-$, $\rho^-\pi^+$ interference region and/or to separate the high-energy $\pi^0$ from the single photons from the radiative decays background in the  $\rho^0\pi^0$, $\rho^\pm\pi^\mp$ interference regions. At high luminosity, the analysis may take advantage of the Dalitz decays of the $\pi^0$ or the photon conversion in the detector material.

\subsubsection{Angle $\beta$} 
	The CKM angle $\beta$ is measured from the time-dependent \CP asymmetry of $b\to c\bar c s$ decays, such as  
	%with a charmonium state and a $K$ meson in the final state. 
	%which measures Im$\lambda_f=$Im$(q/p \bar{A}_f/A_f)$. 
	%The archetypal $b\to c\bar c s$ process is 
	$B\to J/\psi K_S$.  The decay amplitude,  $A_{J/\psi K_S} = V_{cs}V_{cb}^* T + V_{us}V_{ub}^* P$, is dominated by the isoscalar tree-level amplitude $T$, while the subleading term $P$ is both loop and doubly Cabibbo suppressed. Neglecting $P$, 
	%the expression of 
	the time-dependent \CP asymmetry, $a^{\CP}_t(B\to J/\psi K_S)=\sin2\beta\,\sin(\Delta m_B\, t)$,  has a single oscillatory term, the amplitude of which gives experimental access to $\sin2\beta$ (the fourfold ambiguity in $\beta$ can be reduced through time-dependent transversity analysis of $B\to J/\psi K^*$, sensitive to $\cos2\beta$).
	%, providing a determination of the CKM angle with a four-fold ambiguity.~\footnote{This ambiguity can be reduced using measurements sensitive to $\cos2\beta$ such as the time-dependent transversity analysis of $B\to J/\psi K^*$.} 
	The $P=0$ approximation is justified as long as the relative error on $\sin2\beta$ is larger than the correction induced by the subleading term $\sim \lambda^2 P/T$. The present relative uncertainty on $\sin2\beta$ from various charmonium states, including $J/\psi$ / $\psi(2S)$ / $\chi_{c1}$ / $\eta_c$ $K_S$, $J/\psi K_L$, $\psi(nS)K^0$, is about $2.4\%$. Double Cabibbo suppression amounts to $5\%$ and $P/T < 1$ is expected. Yet the precise suppression due to $P/T$ is unknown, likely ranging between some tens and a few percent, the latter estimate given by the perturbative evaluation of the penguing amplitude. Thus, depending on the actual value of $P/T$, the subleading amplitude could be a limiting factor for the extraction of $\sin2\beta$ already now or, in the opposite case, be safely neglected
	down to an experimental precision of few permille. In order to bound the subleading amplitude, one can use $SU(3)$ flavour (or U-spin) related decays where the penguin contribution is not suppressed, such as $B_s\to J/\psi K_s$ or $B\to J/\psi \pi$~\cite{Fleischer:1999nz,Ciuchini:2005mg,Faller:2008zc,Ciuchini:2011kd,Jung:2012mp,DeBruyn:2014oga}. Measuring branching ratios and (time-dependent) \CP asymmetries, it is possible to extract the correction to $\sin2\beta$ induced by the subleading term and the corresponding uncertainty, due to the experimental errors and $SU(3)$-breaking effects. The latter, being proportional to a suppressed amplitude, are expected to be at the permille level.
	
	With present data, the typical shift in $\beta$ is $0.5$--$1^\circ$ with about $100\%$ uncertainty, dominated by the experimental uncertainties. Improvements in the measurement of the time-dependent asymmetry in $B\to J/\psi K_S$ should therefore be accompanied by a corresponding improvement in the measurement of the control channels in order to keep the subleading amplitude under control and extract $\sin2\beta$ with a subpercent precision.
	It is worth mentioning that a complemetary approach proposing a theoretical computation of the subleading amplitude using an OPE based on soft-collinear factorization in QCD can be found in Ref.~\cite{Frings:2015eva}.
	Assuming that the subleading amplitude is kept under control, the uncertainty on the indirect determination of $\sin2\beta$ from the UT analysis is expected to go from the present 4.5\% down to 0.6\%, providing an improved sensitivity to NP in the $B$--$\bar B$ mixing amplitude, as discussed further below.


\subsubsection{Angle $\gamma$}

% S. Descotes-Genon

The current best sensitivity is obtained from charged 
$B$ decays into $\tilde{D} K^-$, $\tilde{D}^{*} K^-$, $\tilde{D} K^{*-}$, and $\tilde{D} K^-\pi^+\pi^-$, where $\tilde{D}$
is a $D^0$ or $\overline{D}^0$ meson decaying to the same final state. The $D^0$ is produced through
the leading $b \to c$ transition, with the amplitude ${\cal A}_{b\to c}\propto \lambda^3$, and $\overline{D}^0$ in the
% through 
CKM and colour-suppressed $b \to u$ transition,  ${\cal A}_{b\to u}\propto \lambda^3 \big({\bar{\eta}^2+\bar{\rho}^2}\big)^{1/2} e^{i( \delta_B - \gamma)}$.
%The amplitude ${\cal A}_{b\to c}$ is proportional 
%to $\lambda^3$, while the amplitude  ${\cal A}_{b\to u}$ is proportional
%to $\lambda^3 \sqrt{\bar{\eta}^2+\bar{\rho}^2}$ $\times e^{i( \delta_B - \gamma)}$.
Since $D^0$ and $\overline{D}^0$ decay to a common final state, 
the interference between the two tree amplitudes leads to observables that 
depend on the relative weak phase $\gamma$ and results in different 
$B^+$ and $B^-$ decay rates.
The size of this interference also depends on the magnitude of the ratio
of the two amplitudes, $r_B\equiv \vert {\cal A}_{b\to u}/$ ${\cal A}_{b\to c} \vert$,
and the relative strong phase $\delta_B$.
The value of $r_B$, which determines the size of the direct \CP\ asymmetry,
is predicted~\cite{Gronau:2002mu} to lie in the range 0.05--0.2. Experimental sensitivity to $\gamma$
decreases with smaller $r_B$.
%The smaller
%the $r_B$ is, the smaller is the experimental sensitivity to $\gamma$.

There are several different methods that exploit the above interference pattern: the Gronau-London-Wyler (GLW)
method~\cite{Gronau:1990ra,Gronau:1991dp} where the neutral $D$ meson is
reconstructed in a \CP\ eigenstate; the Atwood-Dunietz-Soni (ADS)
method~\cite{Atwood:1994zm,Atwood:1996ci,Atwood:2000ck} where the $D^0$ meson,
associated with the ${\cal A}_{b\to c}$ amplitude, is required to decay to a doubly
Cabibbo-suppressed decay (DCSD), while the $\overline{D}^0$ meson, associated with the
${\cal A}_{b\to u}$ amplitude, decays to a Cabibbo-favoured final state, such as
$K^+\pi^-$; the Giri-Grossman-Soffer-Zupan (GGSZ) method~\cite{Giri:2003ty} 
where the neutral $D$ meson is reconstructed in self-conjugate three-body 
final state such as $K_S^0 h^+ h^-$ (where $h=\pi$ or $K$). These $\gamma$ extraction techniques 
rely on clean theoretical assumptions since the decay amplitudes 
are completely tree-level dominated, to an excellent 
approximation~\cite{Brod:2013sga}.
All variants are sensitive to the same $B$ decay parameters and can therefore
be combined in a single fit to extract the common weak phase $\gamma$, as well 
as the hadronic parameters associated with each method.

In addition to the above approaches, it is also possible to measure $\gamma$ from time-dependent analyses of $B^0$ and $B^0_s$ decays, as well as from decays of $b$-baryons. These methods offer significant additional sensitivity and are discussed further in Sec.~\ref{sec:expckm}.% and Sec.~\ref{}.

\subsubsection{Angle $\beta_s$}
	The angle $\beta_s$ belongs to the squeezed UT $\sum_{q_u} V_{q_u b}^*V_{q_u s}=0$ instead of the usual $\sum_{q_u} V_{q_u b}^*V_{q_u d}=0$. Given its reduced sensitivity to $\bar{\rho}$ and $\bar{\eta}$, it is not a strong constraint in the UT plane. On the other hand, the UT analysis provides a very precise indirect determination of its value that can be compared with the direct determination extracted from time-dependent transversality analysis of $B_s\to\phi K_S$. At present, we have $\beta_s^\mathrm{direct} = 0.60\pm 0.88$ and  $\beta_s^\mathrm{UTA} = 1.06\pm 0.03$. The future uncertainties of the direct and indirect determinations are expected to be $\pm 0.01$ and $\pm 0.007$ respectively, allowing for a deeper investigation of BSM contributions to $B_s$--$\bar{B}_s$ mixing amplitude.
	It is worth noting that, similarly to the measurement of phase $\beta$, the shifts of a few degrees in the value of $\beta_s$ extracted from the time-dependent analysis caused by the subleading amplitude cannot be excluded. These shifts, however, now  produce a much larger relative uncertainty, since $\beta_s$ itself is doubly Cabibbo suppressed. %Indeed, for this reason, s
	Some control of doubly Cabibbo suppressed contributions is thus required to meaningfully extract $\beta_s$ at the SM level.
	This can be achieved by using 
	%Also here, this control can be provided by 
	the $SU(3)_f$ related channels, with the additional caveat that $\phi$ is an (almost equal) admixture of $SU(3)_f$ octet and singlet, introducing an additional source of symmetry breaking.


\subsubsection{$K-\bar{K}$ mixing} 
The CP-violating parameter $\varepsilon_K$, historically the first constraint in the UT plane, is becoming limited by long-distance contributions.
In the last years, the improvements in the constraining power of $\varepsilon_K$ have come from new determination of the bag parameter, $B_K$, on the lattice. Nowadays, the theoretical error on $B_K$  is approaching percent level. The dominating uncertainty in the SM prediction of $\epsilon_K$ comes from the long-distance contributions, the best estimate for which has an error of $2\%$~\cite{Buras:2010pza}, and no clear path of improvement. A breakthrough could come from developing ideas for computing these terms on the lattice, using recent techniques to cope with the non-local operators.


\subsubsection{$B_d-\bar{B}_d$ and $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ mixing}

% S. Descotes-Genon

The dispersive and absorptive contributions to  $B_d$ and $B_s$ mixing are described by $2\times2$ matrices, 
%can be described upon introducing
%the mass and decay matrices, 
$M^q=M^{q\dagger}$ and
$\Gamma^q=\Gamma^{q\dagger}$, respectively ($q=d,s$). 
They describe the quantum-mechanical evolution

of the  $B_q-\overline{B}_q$ system. 
%oscillations (with $q=d$ or $q=s$).
Their diagonalisation defines the physical eigenstates $\ket{B^q_H}$ and
$\ket{B^q_L}$ with masses
$M^q_H,\,M^q_L$ and decay rates $\Gamma^q_H,\,\Gamma^q_L$.
One can reexpress these quantities in terms of three parameters:   $|M_{12}^q|$,
$|\Gamma_{12}^q|$ and the relative phase $\phi_q=\arg(-M_{12}^q/\Gamma_{12}^q)$.
The SM prediction for the mass splitting, $\Delta m_q=M_H^q-M_L^q$,  is dominated by boxes involving top quarks, and is given by,
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eqof-dmd}
	   \dm_q = \frac{G_F^2}{6 \pi^2}\eta_B m_{B_q}f_{B_q}^2 {\hat{B}}_q
		  m_W^2 S(x_t) \left|V_{tq} V_{tb}^*\right|^2,
	\end{equation}
with  the Inami-Lim function $S(x_t)$~\cite{Inami:1980fz} evaluated at $x_{t}=\overline{m}_t^2/m_W^2$, while
$\eta_B$ encodes the perturbative QCD corrections, 
%. The value and uncertainty for the perturbative QCD
%correction $\eta_{B}$ was 
originally estimated in Ref.~\cite{Buchalla:1995vs}.
Using up-to-date $\alpha_{s}$ and the top-quark mass gives $\eta_{B} = 0.5510 \pm 0.0022$~\cite{Lenz:2010gu}.
%The prediction involves also non-perturbative inputs, t
The decay constant $f_{B_q}$ and the so-called bag parameter, $\hat{B}_q$, parametrize the nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements.  
%(which is defined by comparison with the vacuum insertion approximation).

The translation of the measured value for $\Delta m_d$ into constraints
on the CKM parameter combination ${|V_{td}^{\phantom{*}} V_{tb}^{*}|}^{2}$
is limited at present by uncertainties in the lattice QCD calculation of the
hadronic parameters $f_{B_{d}},  B_{B_{d}}$. The ratios $f_{B_s}/f_{B_d}$ and $B_{B_s}/B_{B_d}$ are much better determined, so that 
%it makes sense to consider 
$\Delta m_d/\Delta m_s$ gives a much better constraint in the $(\bar \rho,\bar \eta)$ plane, see Fig. \ref{CKMfitterSummer2018}. 
%The SM prediction for $\Delta m_s$ depends on CKM matrix elements $\vert V^*_{ts}V^{\phantom{*}}_{tb}\vert^2$, which only weakly depend on $\bar \rho,\bar \eta$.
%%   of the Standard Model prediction  on
%%$\bar \rho-\bar \eta$ coordinates appears to be very weak through the relevant
%%CKM matrix elements term $\vert V^*_{ts}V^{\phantom{*}}_{tb}\vert^2$.
%When combined with the $\Delta m_d$ measurement the measured $\Delta m_s$ value
%improves the ${|V_{td}^{\phantom{*}} V_{tb}^{*}|}^{2}$ constraint obtained from
%$\Delta m_d$. 
The hadronic
parameters, $f_{B_{s}}$, $B_{B_{s}}$, as well as $f_{B_s}/f_{B_d}$ and $B_{B_s}/B_{B_d}$,
are set to have their errors significantly reduced  by future lattice QCD computations, see Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice}.

\subsection{Combined contraints on the CKM parameters}\label{sec:2018ckmfit}
Due to its economical structure in terms of only four parameters 
%and
%its consequences for \CP violation, 
the CKM matrix can be
determined through many different quark transitions, both the 
 $\Delta F = 1$ decays and the $\Delta F=2$ neutral-meson mixing transitions. A consistent determination of the four CKM parameters from all these processes is a fundamental test of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism. 
Extracting the information on the four CKM parameters from data poses both experimental and theoretical challenges.
% for both experimentalists and theorists. 
First of all, the SM depends on a number of other parameters, masses and couplings, which are not predicted within the SM, but rather need to also be determined experimentally. An additional difficulty relates to the presence of strong interactions, binding quarks into hadrons. This is responsible for most of the theoretical uncertainties in the determinations of CKM matrix elements. 


\subsubsection{Statistical approaches}



The CKMfitter group determines the CKM parameters from a large set of flavour physics constraints using a standard $\chi^2$-like frequentist approach, in addition to a specific (Rfit) scheme to treat theoretical uncertainties~\cite{Charles:2004jd,Charles:2011va,Charles:2015gya}. The set of experimental observables, denoted $\vec {\cal O}_{exp}$, is measured in terms of likelihoods that can be used to build a \chisq-like test statistic,
%\begin{equation}
$\chi^2(\vec{p})=-2\log {\mathcal{L}}(\vec {\cal O}_{exp}-\vec {\cal O}_{th}(\vec p))$,
%\end{equation}
with $\vec {\cal O}_{th}(\vec p)$ the theoretical values of the observables depending on $N$ fixed parameters $\vec p$. The absolute minimum value of the test statistic, $\chi^2_{\rm min}$, quantifies the agreement of the data with the theoretical model, once converted into a $p$-value (interpreting $\chi^2(\vec{p})$
as a random variable distributed according to a $\chi^2$ law).
%, generally relying on Wilks' theorem). 
It is also possible to perform the metrology of specific parameters of the model, 
%Indeed, if we c
by considering the $\vec\mu$ hadronic parameters as ``nuisance parameters'', 
and 
%we can 
defining the test statistic,
% from the \chisq difference:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:deltachisq}
$ \Delta\chi^2(\alpha) = \min_{\vec\mu}[\chi^2(\alpha)] - \chi^2_{\rm min}$~\cite{Hocker:2001xe,Charles:2004jd,Charles:2016qtt}.
%\end{equation}
Here,  $\min_{\vec\mu}[\chi^2(\alpha)]$ is the value of  \chisq, minimised with respect to the nuisance parameters for a  fixed $\alpha$ value. This test statistic assesses how a given hypothesis on the true value of $\alpha$ agrees with the data, irrespective of the value of the nuisance parameters. Confidence intervals on $\alpha$ can be derived from the resulting $p$-value, which is computed assuming that $\Delta\chi^2(\alpha)$ is \chisq-distributed with one degree of freedom,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prob}
 p(\alpha) = {\rm Prob}(\Delta\chi^2(\alpha),N_{dof}=1)\,, \qquad  {\rm Prob}\!\left(\Delta \chi^2,N_{dof}\right)=\frac{\Gamma(N_{dof}/2,\Delta\chi^2/2)}{\Gamma(N_{dof}/2)}\,.
\end{equation}
Confidence intervals at a given confidence level (CL) are obtained by selecting the values of $\alpha$ with $p$-value larger than $1-$CL.

In addition to the frequentist statistical treatment outline above, the CKMfitter collaboration relies on a specific treatment of theoretical uncertainties (e.g., systematics due to uncertainties on hadronic matrix elements not scaling with the size of the sample).
% which are particularly relevant in the field of flavour physics (e.g. uncertainties on hadronic matrix elements). 
The current approach is the so-called Rfit~\cite{Hocker:2001xe,Charles:2004jd,Charles:2016qtt} model, 
%corresponding to a constraint to $\chi^2$ restricting the value of the 
where the theoretical parameter/observable is restricted to a range, without any possibility to exceed this range. Most of the systematic uncertainties come from lattice QCD. The CKMfitter collaboration follows the recommendations of the Flavour Lattice Averaging Group~\cite{Aoki:2016frl} and uses a specific procedure to perform the average of the lattice inputs based on the Rfit model combined with a linear addition of systematic uncertainties for the individual inputs~\cite{Charles:2016qtt}.

	The UTfit collaboration follows a Bayesian approach to combine the constraints in the UT plane.  Bayesian statistics allows for a unified treatment of systematic and theoretical uncertainties in a scheme of "updating of knowledge" from prior to posterior distributions.
	% that is quite intuitive and easy to implement.
Following Bayes theorem, the unnormalized posterior probability density function (p.d.f.)\ for $\bar\rho$ and $\bar\eta$ (given the constraints) is,
% written as
	\begin{equation}
	f(\bar\rho,\bar\eta|\mathbf{\hat{c}}, \mathbf{\hat{f}}) \propto 
	{\cal L}(\mathbf{\hat{c}}\,|\,\bar\rho,\bar\eta,\mathbf{f})\, f_0(\bar\rho,\bar\eta).
	\label{eq:flat_inf}
	\end{equation}
Here $\mathbf{\hat{c}}=\{c_1,c_2,\dots,c_M\}$ is a set of measured constraints, whose theoretical expressions are given by functions $c_j(\bar\rho,\bar\eta;\mathbf{x})$ that depend on $\bar\rho$, $\bar\eta$, and a set of additional experimental and theoretical parameters ${\mathbf x}=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N\}$. The $f_0(\bar\rho,\bar\eta)$ is the prior p.d.f.\ for $\bar\rho$ and $\bar\eta$, assumed to be flat on the UT plane, and is multiplied by the effective overall likelihood,
%${\cal L}(\mathbf{\hat{c}}\,|\,\bar\rho,\bar\eta,\mathbf{f})$ is
    \begin{equation}
    {\cal L}(\mathbf{\hat{c}}\,|\,\bar\rho,\bar\eta,\mathbf{f})
    = \int 
    \prod_{j=1,{\rm M}}f_j(\hat{c}_j\,|\,\bar\rho,\bar\eta,\mathbf{x})
    \prod_{i=1,{\rm N}}f_i(x_i)\, \mbox{d}{ x_i}\,.
    \label{eq:lik_int}
    \end{equation}
	The p.d.f.\ $f_i=\{f_1,f_2,\dots,f_N\}$ are the prior distributions of the parameters, while  $f_j(\hat{c}_j\,|\,\bar\rho,\bar\eta,\mathbf{x})$ are the conditional probabilities of $\hat{c}_j$ given $\bar\rho$, $\bar\eta$, and $\mathbf{x}$, that in the Gaussian approximation become
    \begin{equation}	
	f_j(\hat{c}_j\,|\,\bar\rho,\bar\eta,\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\,\sigma(c_j)}
	\exp\left[-\frac{(c_j(\bar\rho, \bar\eta; \mathbf{x})-
		\hat{c}_j)^2}{2\,\sigma^2(c_j)}\right]\,.
    \end{equation}
    The integration in Eq. (\ref{eq:lik_int}) is usually carried out using Monte Carlo methods. More details on the Bayesian approach of the UTfit collaboration can be found in Ref.\cite{Ciuchini:2000de}.

%, we find that
the four CKM parameters,

\begin{equation}

\quad
\bar\eta=0.3493^{\,+0.0095}_{\,-0.0071}.
\end{equation}
The asymmetric errors come from the combination of several constraints containing both statistical and systematic uncertainties, so that the resulting $\chi^2$ has a rather complicated asymmetric shape. The corresponding results are shown in Fig.~\ref{CKMfitterSummer2018}.
The fit shows a good overall consistency among the various constraints. The main pulls come from the kaon and charm sector, but nothing exceeds the 2-$\sigma$ level, confirming the very good overall agreement of the various constraints involved here.

\subsection{Theoretical prospects}
\subsubsection{Lattice extrapolations}
%\td{what do we do with this? A few sentences about Chapter 11?}
Advancement in the lattice QCD determination of hadronic matrix elements, used in the extraction of CKM elements, need to go hand in hand with the improved experimental precision. The projections on the expected errors for the most important hadronic matrix elements are  discussed in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice} with the main results collected in Table \ref{table:Proj}.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Lattice extrapolations
%\item Issue of isospin and radiative corrections
%\end{itemize}

The accuracy of the projections below will also require an improvement in the understanding of electromagnetic corrections, which for the moment are only partially addressed in theoretical predictions. Further details on the inclusion of QED corrections in lattice predictions are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice}.


\subsubsection{Other theoretical issues}

% J. Charles
%\td{to be shortened}
The determination of $\gamma$ has negligible theoretical errors. 
In contrast, 
%to the determination of $\gamma$ from decays with a single CKM amplitude, 
%the 
extractions of $\beta$ and $\beta_s$ 
%(where $\phi_d=2\beta$, $\phi_s=-2\beta_s$) 
from $b\to c\bar cs$ transitions receive small theoretical uncertainty from penguin diagrams. For present data the penguin contributions in $b\to c\bar cs$ are assumed to be negligible. However, they may compete with the statistical errors in the future. Techniques to estimate the penguin contributions from data on SU(3)-related channels are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:b2ccspenguin}. An independent, more theory-driven, cross-check of the SU(3) approach was suggested  %A different,  approach has been proposed 
in Ref.~\cite{Frings:2015eva} -- to use Operator Product Expansion to calculate the penguin-to-tree ratio.
% and constraint the penguin contribution to the CKM phase. It thus provides . 
In the determination of $\alpha$, the small penguin contributions are avoided using isospin symmetry. The associated theory error on $\alpha$ due to isospin breaking  
%so that the dominant source of theoretical uncertainty comes from isospin symmetry breaking. Depending on the considered channel ($\pi\pi$, $\rho\rho$ or $\rho\pi$), it can take the form of electroweak penguins, light meson mixing or resonance effects. In all cases then impact on $\alpha$ 
has been estimated to be at sub degree level~\cite{Charles:2017evz}. It is neglected at present, but will need to be taken into account in significantly larger statistics samples.

% are available.

%Another highly discussed 
An open issue is the (in)compatibility of the inclusive and exclusive determinations of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$,
%. Indeed in both cases

%  published. 
Recently, the $|V_{cb}|$ discrepancy was shown to depend significantly on the choice of the form factor parametrisation, and 
%more specifically 
on the hypotheses made about the underlying heavy quark symmetry~\cite{Grinstein:2017nlq,Bigi:2017njr}. Relaxing these choices leads to an exclusive determination of $|V_{cb}|$  that is in good agreement with the inclusive one, but with unexpectedly large corrections to the heavy quark symmetry predictions~\cite{Bernlochner:2017xyx}. As for $|V_{ub}|$ no satisfying explanation of the discrepancy has been found so far. In the future more precise exclusive measurements by LHCb and Belle II, and more precise inclusive analysis by Belle II, should shed light on this topic by investigating whether it could be an experimental effect or not.


%Final comment is that, if deviation from the SM are observed in the CKM fits, it will be very important to measuring its imprint on different observables
%
%To properly identify the BSM model, if deviations are observed,  is very important, as stressed, e.g., in Ref. \cite{Buras:2013ooa}.

\subsection{Future of global CKM fits}

\subsubsection{Summary of the projections}

% S. Descotes-Genon

As discussed above, HL-LHC will improve the determination of several flavour observables crucial for the extraction of  CKM parameters.
We consider two phases for the HL-LHC projections: in Phase 1, we assume integrated luminosity of 23 fb$^{-1}$ for LHCb and 300 fb$^{-1}$ for CMS/ATLAS; in Phase 2 we have 300 fb$^{-1}$ for LHCb  and 3000 fb$^{-1}$ for CMS/ATLAS.
Several observables will be measured more precisely at Belle II. For uncertainties on these observables we use the 50 ab$^{-1}$ projections in Ref.~\cite{Kou:2018nap}. 
 Since we are
interested in  the future sensitivity for Phase 1 and Phase 2, we choose the central values of future measurements to coincide
with their SM predictions using the current best-fit values of $\rhobar$ and
$\etabar$.

\subsubsection{CKMfitter results}
% S. Descotes-Genon

The inputs used by CKMfitter collaboration for the fits are shown in Table~\ref{tab:CKMfitterprojinputs}. For easier comparison the ``Current'' column shows present uncertainties, taking  
%with current situation,
%we have added a column  corresponding to the current situation concerning uncertainties, but 
take central values corresponding to a perfect agreement of the various constraints in the SM. Note that this choice does change slightly the present determination of CKM parameters -- the global fit described in Sec.~\ref{sec:2018ckmfit} exhibits slight discrepancies, in particular for $|V_{us}|$, which currently increases the accuracy of the determination of the CKM parameters. In order to determine the increase in accuracy on the CKM parameters in a fair way, we therefore compare the three scenarios presented in Table~\ref{tab:CKMfitterprojinputs} with the same central values taken to have perfect agreement (rather than comparing the future projections with the CKMfitter results for the Summer 2018 update).

From the global fit we determine the 68\% CL intervals for the 4 CKM parameters and other parameters of interest. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:CKMfitterglobalsmall} we show the Phase 1 (left panels) and Phase 2 (right panels)  determinations in the standard UT plane for a global fit (upper), as well as when using only subsets of constraints, tree only (middle) or loop only (lower panels).
%details various details of the constraints
The uncertainties obtained are listed in Table~\ref{tab:CKMfitterprojresults}.
% while the corresponding constraints in the $(\bar\rho,\bar\eta$) plane are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CKMfitterglobal}. 
We also show in Fig.~\ref{fig:CKMfitterglobalBs} the corresponding constraints for the $B_s$ meson system, defining the apex of the $B_s$ unitarity triangle as~\cite{Charles:2015gya}
\begin{equation}
\bar\rho_{sb}+i\bar\eta_{sb}=-\frac{V_{us}V_{ub}^*}{V_{cs}V_{cb}^*}.

\subsubsection{UTfit results}
The projection of the UT analysis in the HL-LHC era is obtained by performing a global fit using the same future expected values of experimental and theoretical input parameters as CKMfitter, Table \ref{tab:CKMfitterprojinputs}. In particular, the lattice uncertainties for Phase 1 and Phase 2 are the same as Table~\ref{table:Proj} in Sec.~\ref{sec:lattice}. 
%while future experimental uncertainties are collected in Table~\ref{tab:CKMfitterprojinputs} for phase 1 and 2. 
For both theoretical and experimental parameters the SM expectations were takes as central values, in order to ensure the compatibility of the extrapolated constraints.

The improvement of the UT global analysis can be appreciated in Fig.~\ref{fig:UTfitFut}, where the present and future Phase 1 and Phase 2 constraints on the standard UT plane are shown next to each other, after zooming on the SM preferred region.
For a more quantitative comparison we collect in Table~\ref{tab:utfit_global} the uncertainties on the indirect determination of CKM parameters and angles, obtained from the predictive posterior p.d.f.'s (i.e., obtained without including the corresponding direct measurements in the fit). These uncertainties are reduced by a factor 3--5 for Phase 1, and are further reduced by up to a factor of 2 for Phase 2,
allowing for an increasingly improved tests of the SM, as discussed next. Similar progression of improvements is seen in the projections from CKMfitter collaboration, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:CKMfitterglobalsmall}.

\subsection{Future extrapolation of constraints on NP in $\Delta F=2$
  amplitudes}
\label{sec:DF2NP}

% Luca Silvestrini and Marco Ciuchini

The Unitarity Triangle Analysis can be generalized beyond the SM to
obtain a simultaneous determination of CKM parameters and NP
contributions to $\Delta F=2$ amplitudes \cite{Bona:2007vi}. Assuming
that NP is absent (or negligible) in charged current amplitudes, but
allowing for NP to be present in FCNC amplitudes, where its virtual
effects compete with loop-level SM amplitudes, we can still use the
measurements of $\vert V_{ud}\vert$, $\vert V_{us}\vert$, $\vert
V_{cb}\vert$, $\vert V_{ub}\vert$, $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ (allowing for
NP contributions in penguins, but barring order-of-magnitude
enhancements of electroweak penguins) to obtain the ``tree-level''
determination of the UT. This allows us
to obtain the SM prediction for $K$, $B_{d}$ and $B_{s}$ mixing
amplitudes. Comparing them with the experimental results we can
extract 
$C_{\varepsilon_K} = \varepsilon_K/\varepsilon_K^\mathrm{SM}$
and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cbqphibq}
  C_{B_q} e^{i \phi_{B_q}} = \frac{\langle B_q \lvert H^\mathrm{SM+NP}
    \rvert \bar{B}_q \rangle}{\langle B_q \lvert H^\mathrm{SM}
    \rvert \bar{B}_q \rangle}\,.
\end{equation}
The SM point is $C_i=1, \phi_i=0$. 
Using semileptonic asymmetries it is possible to break the degeneracy
for $\gamma \leftrightarrow \gamma + 180^\circ$ present in the
tree-level determination of the CKM matrix \cite{Laplace:2002ik},
getting rid of the solution in the third quadrant. We then obtain the
results in Table~\ref{tab:UTAgen} for the projected errors on CKM parameters and on the NP parameters. Note that at present the NP contribution that are about an order of magnitude smaller than the SM are still perfectly allowed. At the end or Phase 2 we will be able to probe amplitudes that are another factor of 4 smaller than it is possible at present (corresponding to about a factor of 2 higher reach in the NP scale for dimension 6 NP operators).  The
corresponding two-dimensional distributions for $B_d$ and $B_s$ mixing are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:UTAgen}.

Combining the results of the generalized UT analysis with the
constraints on \CP violation in $D$ mixing from Sec. \ref{sec:CPV:mixing:Dmeson},
%\td{cite}\textbf{refer to
%  $D$ mixing combination},
   we can consider the most general $\Delta
F=2$ effective Hamiltonian and bound its coefficients (barring
accidental cancellations). The most general effective Hamiltonians for $\Delta F=2$ processes
beyond the SM have the following form \cite{Gabbiani:1996hi} (with $q_1q_2=sd,uc,bq$ for $M=K,D,B_q$)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:defheff}
  {\cal H}_{\rm eff}^{M-\bar M}=\sum_{i=1}^{5} C_i\, Q_i^{q_1q_2} +
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \tilde{C}_i\, \tilde{Q}_i^{q_1q_2}, 
%  \\
%  {\cal H}_{\rm eff}^{D-\bar D}=\sum_{i=1}^{5} C_i\, Q_i^{uc} +
%  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \tilde{C}_i\, \tilde{Q}_i^{uc} \\
%  {\cal H}_{\rm eff}^{B_q-\bar B_q}=\sum_{i=1}^{5} C_i\, Q_i^{bq} +
%  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \tilde{C}_i\, \tilde{Q}_i^{bq} \nonumber
\end{equation}
where the operator basis consists of  dimension 6 operators
$Q_1^{q_iq_j} =\big(\bar q^{\alpha}_{jL} \gamma_\mu q^{\alpha}_{iL}\big)\big( \bar q^{\beta}_{jL} \gamma^\mu q^{\beta}_{iL}\big)$, 
$ Q_2^{q_iq_j}=\big(\bar q^{\alpha}_{jR}  q^{\alpha}_{iL}\big)\big( \bar q^{\beta}_{jR} q^{\beta}_{iL}\big)$, 
 $Q_3^{q_iq_j} =\big(\bar q^{\alpha}_{jR}  q^{\beta}_{iL}\big)\big(\bar q^{\beta}_{jR} q^{\alpha}_{iL}\big)$, 
$ Q_4^{q_iq_j} = \big(\bar q^{\alpha}_{jR}  q^{\alpha}_{iL}\big)\big(\bar q^{\beta}_{jL} q^{\beta}_{iR}\big)$, 
$ Q_5^{q_iq_j} = \big(\bar q^{\alpha}_{jR}  q^{\beta}_{iL}\big)\big(\bar q^{\beta}_{jL} q^{\alpha}_{iR}\big)$, 
and the operators $\tilde{Q}_{1,2,3}^{q_iq_j}$ that are obtained from the
$Q_{1,2,3}^{q_iq_j}$ by exchanging $ L \leftrightarrow R$.  Here
$q_{R,L}=P_{R,L}\,q$, with $P_{R,L}=(1 \pm \gamma_5)/2$, and $\alpha$
and $\beta$ are colour indices. Following the procedure detailed in Ref.~\cite{Bona:2007vi}, the UTFit collaboration obtained
p.d.f.'s for the Wilson coefficients based on the extrapolated UT and
$D$ mixing analyses. For self-consistency, the coefficients are computed
at a scale $\mu_H$ roughly corresponding to the bound on the NP scale
$\Lambda$ that one obtains from the analysis (see below). The
present and expected Phase 2 allowed regions at $95\%$ probability on the Wilson coefficients 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:CiLambda}
  C_i(\Lambda) = \frac{F_i L_i}{\Lambda^2}\,,
\end{equation}
are reported in Fig.  \ref{fig:DF2Lambda}. In left panel in Fig.  \ref{fig:DF2Lambda} the flavour and loop factors were set to $F_i=L_i=1$, i.e., this shows the limits on the mass of NP states that contribute to meson mixing at tree level and couple with ${\mathcal O}(1)$ strength to the corresponding SM fermions. In Fig. \ref{fig:DF2Lambda} right, the flavour factor was set to $F_i=V_{t q_1}V_{t q_2}^*$, and the loop factor to $L_i=\alpha_2^2$, with $\alpha_2$ the weak structure constant. That is, the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:DF2Lambda} shows the reach for masses of NP states that have MFV like couplings to SM fermions and contribute only at one loop level. 

%in Table
%\ref{tab:DF2Cbounds}. The regions for $\tilde{C}_i$ are identical to
%the ones for the corresponding $C_i$.
%
%In general, the coefficients at the NP scale can be written as
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:CiLambda}
%  C_i(\Lambda) = \frac{F_i L_i}{\Lambda^2}\,,
%\end{equation}
%where $\Lambda$ is the NP scale corresponding to the new heavy
%particles mediating the $\Delta F=2$ transition, $F_i$ is a flavour
%coupling and $L_i$ is the overall strength, \textit{e.g.} a loop
%factor. For a strongly-interacting NP model with arbitrary flavour
%structure one expects $F_i \sim L_i \sim 1$, so with this assumption
%we can convert the allowed regions for $C_i$ in the lower bounds on the
%NP scale $\Lambda$ reported in Table \ref{tab:DF2Cbounds} and in
%Fig. \ref{fig:DF2Lambda}.
