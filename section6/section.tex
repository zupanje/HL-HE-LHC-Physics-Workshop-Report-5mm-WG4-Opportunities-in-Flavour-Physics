\subsection{Combined theory/experiment perspective}
%Including how far ATLAS/CMS can contribute to finding new states, confirming the %pentaquark etc. observations, and studying their properties (?)
Hadronic spectroscopy has been a very challenging field historically, from both the
experimental and theoretical perspectives. While \belletwo will make a major impact 
in the study of excited mesons and lighter exotic hadrons, only the HL-LHC experiments 
have the potential to comprehensively study the full range of possible excited
hadronic states. Such a comprehensive understanding and characterisation of quark
structures would not only in some sense complete the taxonomy of SM particles, but
would also sharpen our understanding of QCD in a particularly difficult energy
regime. For this reason, while not directly probing BSM physics, spectroscopy
measurements will continue to make essential contributions to the interpretation
of any observed BSM effects in the flavour sector. In addition spectroscopy can provide tools to probe BSM effects by using a new observed state as a tagger\cite{Aaij:2017inn}, \cite{ Aaij:2016rdg}.

While the \upgradetwo of LHCb will
by design offer unparalleled capabilities in this area, the legacy of HL-LHC for
spectroscopy will be much stronger if ATLAS and CMS are also able to continue
pursuing this work in the HL-LHC period. The planned hardware tracking
triggers and much higher data rates sent to their software triggers are promising
in this respect.
