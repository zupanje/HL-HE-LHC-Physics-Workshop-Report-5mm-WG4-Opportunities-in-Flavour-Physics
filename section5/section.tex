\section{Tau leptons}
{\bf Authors (Theory):  Vincenzo Cirigliano, M. Gonzalez-Alonso, Adam Falkowski, Emilie Passemar}

%\subsection{Introduction}
%
The physics of the tau lepton is an exceptionally broad topic, both experimentally and theoretically. A large variety of processes involving taus have been used in the last decades to learn about fundamental physics~\cite{Pich:2013lsa}. 
In some cases the results obtained in $e^+e^-$ machines~\cite{Schael:2005am} are very hard to improve in the LHC environment, due to large backgrounds, even if the number of taus produced is much larger. This is the case, {\it e.g.}, for the study of basic tau properties (mass, lifetime, etc.) or the standard tau decay channels. However, there are also many processes involving taus that are relevant for HL/HE-LHC. Here we focus on those that are more directly connected to flavour and that are not covered by other sections or Working Groups (for instance $h \to \tau \tau$, $h\to\tau\ell$, \td{cite that section} or heavy meson decays to taus \td{cite that section}).

To simplify the discussion we will assume 
%in the rest of this chapter 
that the scale of New Physics  (NP) relevant for the processes under consideration is much heavier than the energy scales probed by the  LHC. We can then use the SMEFT framework~\cite{Buchmuller:1985jz}. We first discuss lepton flavour conserving observables, where the SM contribution has to be calculated with some accuracy in order to probe NP. In contrast, the SM contribution is negligible for lepton flavour violating processes, where the challenges are purely experimental.
%, since the SM contribution is negligible. 
As a result, the NP scales that are probed are much higher  in the latter case.

\subsection{Lepton-flavour-conserving processes}

%First of all, let us note that the c
Collider phenomenology is usually very different for the so-called vertex corrections and contact interactions. Fo vertex corrections the NP contributions mimic the structure of the SM gauge couplings, $Z\tau\tau$ and $W\tau\nu$. Their study requires, in most cases, very precise measurements, which are challenging in a hadron collider. On the other hand, four-fermion contact interactions (generated for example by the tree-level exchange of a heavy mediator) give a contribution to high-energy observables qualitatively different from the SM one. For instance, a contribution from an off-shell mediator grows with the partonic center of mass energy,
% of the partonic process, 
and thus one does not require very high precision in order for the measurements to probe interesting NP scales~\cite{Cirigliano:2012ab,deBlas:2013qqa}. For these contact interactions, we focus on flavour-diagonal couplings involving first-generation quarks and third-generation leptons.

\subsubsection{High-energy tails}
%
LHC measurements of differential distributions in the Drell-Yan lepton production can be sensitive to new effective interactions between leptons and quarks~\cite{Cirigliano:2012ab,deBlas:2013qqa}. 
As an example, consider that the following dimension-6 interaction is added to the SM Lagrangian,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:olq}
{\cal L} \supset {C_{lq}^{(3)} \over \Lambda^2} (\bar L_3 \gamma_\mu  \sigma^i L_3)  (Q_1 \gamma^\mu \sigma^i Q_1), 
\end{equation}  
where $\sigma^i$ are the Pauli matrices, $L_3 = (\nu^\tau_L,\tau_L)$ is the 3rd generation lepton doublet, and $Q_1 = (u_L,d_L)$ is the 1st generation quark doublet. This interaction term can be interpreted as an effective field theory (EFT) description of a more fundamental theory, for example an exchange of an SU(2) triplet of vector bosons with masses $m_V = \Lambda \gg v$ that couples to $L_3$ and $Q_1$ with coupling strength $g_{V} \approx  2 |C_{lq}^{(3)}|^{1/2}$.  
Even when $m_V$ is too heavy to be directly produced at the LHC, the effective interaction in Eq.~(\ref{eq:olq}) may produce observable effects, and therefore provide
% an important piece of 
information about the theory that completes the SM. 

At the LHC, contact interactions between quarks and 3rd generation leptons can be probed via processes $p p \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ and $p p \to \tau \nu$~\cite{Faroughy:2016osc,Cirigliano:2018dyk}. 
Here we focus on the latter, taking as a template the existing Run-2 ATLAS analysis in Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2018vgh}. 
This measured  the  $\tau \nu$ transverse mass
%analysis relies on 
%differential 
distribution, where the transverse mass is given by
% of pairs defined as 
$m_T =\sqrt{ 2 p_{T} E_T (1-\cos \phi) }$, with $\vec p_{T}$  the transverse momentum of the (hadronic) tau candidate,  $\vec E_T$ the missing transverse momentum, and $\phi$ the azimuthal angle between the two. 
The effects of the interaction in Eq.~(\ref{eq:olq}) are most pronounced at higher $m_T$.
To estimate the current and future sensitivity, we pick $m_T > 1.8$~TeV as our signal region (a more elaborate analysis with a wider, binned, $m_T$ range would lead to stronger bounds~\cite{Cirigliano:2018dyk}).
Using the {\tt Madgraph}\cite{Alwall:2014hca}/{\tt Pythia~8}~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}/{\tt Delphes} \cite{deFavereau:2013fsa} simulation chain and imposing the selection cuts we can estimate the expected number of events in the presence of the interaction in Eq.~(\ref{eq:olq}): 
\begin{equation}
N_{p p \to \tau \tau}^{m_T > 1.8~\tev} \approx  \left ({ {\cal L} \over 36.1~{\rm fb}^{-1} } \right )
 \left [ 0.36  + 4.0 \times 10^3 {C_{lq}^{(3)} v^2 \over \Lambda^2} + 3.6 \times 10^5  \left ( {C_{lq}^{(3)} v^2 \over \Lambda^2}  \right )^2 \right ], 
\end{equation}
 where $ {\cal L}$ is the integrated luminosity, $v \approx 246$~GeV, and we will ignore the theoretical error of this estimation. 
The ATLAS collaboration observed $0$ events in  ${\cal L} = 36.1~{\rm fb}^{-1}$~\cite{Aaboud:2018vgh},  from which  one can derive the 68\%~CL limit on the Wilson coefficient in Eq.~(\ref{eq:olq}):  $- (5.3~\tev)^{-2} \leq  C_{lq}^{(3)} / \Lambda^2 \leq (7.7~\tev)^{-2}$.  
%$- {1 \over (5.3~\tev)^2} \leq  {C_{lq}^{(3)} \over \Lambda^2} \leq {1 \over (7.7~\tev)^2}$.  
For the HL-LHC with ${\cal L} = 3000~{\rm fb}^{-1}$,  assuming the observed number of events will be exactly equal to the SM prediction, the expected limit becomes
\beq
- {1 \over (17.5~\tev)^2} \leq  {C_{lq}^{(3)} \over \Lambda^2} \leq {1 \over (20.5~\tev)^2} \qquad @~68\%~{\rm CL}. 
\eeq 
Compared to the present LHC bound, this represents an $\cO(10)$ stronger bound on $C_{lq}^{(3)}/\Lambda^2$, or $\cO(3)$ times improvement in the reach for the mass scale of new physics. 
Assuming maximally strongly coupled new physics, $g_V \sim 4 \pi$, the HL-LHC can probe particles even as heavy as $m_V \sim 100$~TeV. 

There are 3 more independent dimension-6 operators that can be probed by the $p p \to \tau \nu$ process: 
 $O_{l e d q}  =  (\bar L_3 \tau_R)  (\bar d_R  Q_1)$,  $O_{l e q u} =  (\bar L_3 \tau_R) (Q_1 u_R)$, and  
 $O^{(3)}_{l e q u}  =   (\bar L_3  \sigma_{\mu \nu} \tau_R)  (\bar Q_1 \sigma_{\mu \nu} u_R)$~\cite{Cirigliano:2012ab,Grzadkowski:2010es}. 
We estimate that the HL-LHC will be sensitive to $C / \Lambda^2 \sim (10~\tev)^{-2}$ through a one-bin analysis like the one presented above. 
The slightly smaller sensitivity than for the operator in Eq.~(\ref{eq:olq}) follows from the fact that these do not interfere with the SM amplitudes, and thus their effect enters only at quadratic order in $C/\Lambda^2$.

We expect that our simple analysis provides a good qualitative estimate of the HL-LHC reach.  
However, a more sophisticated analysis using the full information about the $m_T$ distribution (such as in Ref.~\cite{Cirigliano:2018dyk}), and possibly also about the $\tau$ polarization, should lead to a further $\cO(1)$ increase of sensitivity. 
Ideally, the optimal analysis should be able to distinguish between different dimension-6 operators (except between $O_{l e d q}$ and  $O_{l e q u}$, which give exactly the same contribution to the $p p \to \tau \nu$ cross section), and provide constraints on the Wilson coefficients in the situation when all the independent operators are simultaneously present.  
Furthermore, the process $p p \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ probes a large set of dimension-6 operators: 
$O_{l q} =  (\bar L_3 \gamma_\mu  L_3)  (Q_1 \gamma^\mu Q_1)$, 
$O_{l u} =  (\bar L_3 \gamma_\mu  L_3)    (\bar u_R \gamma^\mu u_R)$,   
$O_{l d} =  (\bar L_3 \gamma_\mu  L_3)    (\bar d_R \gamma^\mu d_R)$,   
$O_{e q} =  (\bar \tau_R \gamma_\mu  \tau_R)    (\bar Q_1 \gamma^\mu Q_1)$,    
$O_{e u} =  (\bar \tau_R \gamma_\mu  \tau_R)  (\bar u_R \gamma^\mu u_R)$, and
$O_{e d} =  (\bar \tau_R \gamma_\mu  \tau_R)$  $(\bar d_R \gamma^\mu d_R)$, in addition to the operators discussed above. 
We expect comparable sensitivity of  $p p \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ to $C/\Lambda^2$ as in the case of $p p \to \tau \nu$~\cite{Cirigliano:2012ab}. 
It is unlikely that the LHC alone can discriminate between all these operators; to this end combining with low energy precision measurements of $\tau$ decays will be necessary. 
Finally, we mention that $\tau \tau$ and $\tau \nu$ production also probes analogous operators with heavier ($s$, $c$, $b$) quarks instead of the 1st generation ones \cite{Faroughy:2016osc,Altmannshofer:2017poe}. 
The presence of such operators in the Lagrangian can be motivated by the anomalies observed by BaBar and LHCb in the $B \to D^{(*)} \tau \nu$ decays~\cite{Lees:2013uzd,Huschle:2015rga,Sato:2016svk}.  \td{cite that section}
 

\subsubsection{Beyond tails: lepton flavour universality}
%
It has been pointed out recently that there is an interesting complementarity between the  high-energy searches and low-energy precision studies, presented above, and hadronic tau decays~\cite{Cirigliano:2018dyk}. The latter are equally sensitive to vertex and contact interactions, and thus effectively become model-independent probes of LFU violations in the $W\tau\nu$ vertex once the strong LHC bounds described above are taken into account. This is interesting because the only low-energy model-independent measurement of this effect, which was carried out at LEP2, found a $\sim2\sigma$ tension with LFU~\cite{Patrignani:2016xqp,Filipuzzi:2012mg}. Including also hadronic tau decays and LHC bounds on contact interactions, the result is improved by a factor of two, but the (dis)agreement with LFU remains at the $\sim2\sigma$ level: $\delta g_L^{W\tau}-\delta g_L^{We}=0.0134(74)$~\cite{Cirigliano:2018dyk}.

Finally, it is interesting to mention the possibility of accessing LFU violations in the vertex corrections at the (HL/HE) LHC. In the ratio of $W\to\tau\nu$ and $W\to\ell\nu$ many experimental and QCD uncertainties  cancel, which make a per-cent level extraction a bit less complicated. In fact, past studies carried out by the D0 collaboration~\cite{Abbott:1999pk} showed that such precision is indeed possible in a collider environment.

\subsection{Lepton Flavour Violation}
\label{LFV}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV)   processes  involving charged leptons  are  very interesting because 
their observation would be a clear indication of physics beyond the SM. 
While lepton family number is an accidental symmetry of the SM, 
we know it must be broken in order to account for neutrino masses and mixings. 
If the only low-energy manifestation of LFV are neutrino masses and mixings (which corresponds to 
a very high scale for LFV),  then charged LFV amplitude are suppressed by the GIM mechanism 
and the predicted rates are un-observably  small, e.g., $\mathcal B  (\mu \to e\gamma) \sim 10^{-52}$ and $\mathcal B (\tau \to \mu\gamma) \sim 10^{-45}$~\cite{Cheng:1977nv, Lee:1977tib}). 
However, if the breaking of the lepton family symmetry happens not too much above
the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, as borne out in many new physics scenarios,  
then one can expect charged LFV BRs  quite close to existing limits, 
and therefore within reach of ongoing searches. In fact in some cases experimental limits are already excluding regions of parameter space 
in specific weak scale new physics models.  While less severe than in the quark sector,  one has a ``flavour problem" in the lepton sector as well.

A rich literature exists on this topic,  including studies in  supersymmetric extensions of the 
SM,  little Higgs models, low-scale seesaw models, 
leptoquark models,   $Z'$ models,  left-right symmetric models,  and extended Higgs models. 
For  recent reviews on both theoretical and experimental aspects we refer the reader to Refs.~\cite{Calibbi:2017uvl,Bernstein:2013hba}. 
Current limits on BRs in  $\mu$-$e$ transitions are at the level of  $10^{-13}$  
(e.g.  $\mathcal B(\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma) < 4.2
\times 10^{-13}$ (90\% CL) \cite{TheMEG:2016wtm}), while  
$\tau$-$\mu$ and $\tau$-$e$ BRs are bound at the $10^{-8}$ level~~\cite{Amhis:2016xyh}. 
%
As discussed below,  improvements in LFV $\tau$ decays
 will offer the opportunity to explore  
(i) correlations with  $\mu$-$e$ transitions, probing underlying sources of flavour breaking; 
(ii) correlations among different LFV $\tau$ decays, probing the nature of the underlying 
mechanism. 






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Lepton Flavour Violation in $\tau$ decays}
\label{LFVTAU}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Tau decays offer a  rich  landscape to search for CLFV. 
The  $\tau$  lepton is heavy enough to decay into hadrons. Until now already 48 LFV modes have been bounded at the level of $10^{-8}$~\cite{Amhis:2016xyh}.

%as can be seen in

The $B$ factories, BaBar and Belle, have improved by more than a order of magnitude
~\cite{Aubert:2006cz,Aubert:2007kx,Aubert:2009ag,Aubert:2009ys,Aubert:2009ap,Lees:2010ez,Miyazaki:2005ng,Hayasaka:2007vc,Miyazaki:2007jp,
Miyazaki:2008mw,Miyazaki:2010qb,Hayasaka:2010np,Miyazaki:2011xe} 
the previous CLEO bounds~\cite{Bowcock:1989mq,Bonvicini:1997bw,Chen:2002ug} for a significant 
number of modes. 
Some of the modes, for instance, $\tau \to \ell \omega$, have been bounded for the first time~\cite{Aubert:2007kx}. 
%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Tau_LFV}, 
%a similar improvement is expected at Belle-II~\cite{Kou:2018nap}.

The physics reach and model-discriminating power of LFV tau decays is most efficiently analyzed above the electroweak scale using SMEFT, and in a corresponding 
low-energy EFT when below the weak scale~\cite{Celis:2014asa}.
Several  classes of  dimension-six operators contribute  to LFV tau decays at the low-scale, with effective couplings denoted by $C_i/\Lambda^2$.  
Loop-induced dipole  operators mediate radiative decays $\tau \to \ell \gamma$ as well as  purely leptonic $\tau \to 3 \ell$  and semi-leptonic 
decays. Four-fermion -- both four-lepton and semi-leptonic -- operators with different Dirac structures 
can be induced at tree-level or loop-level, and contribute to $\tau \to 3 \ell$ and $\tau \to \ell  \, +  \, {\rm hadrons}$.  
As a typical example,  we note that current limits on $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ probe  scales on the order of $\Lambda / \sqrt{C_{\rm Dipole}} \sim 500$~TeV. 
Besides probing  high scales,  LFV $\tau$ decays offer two main handles to discriminate among underlying models of new physics, i.e., to identify 
which operators are present at low energy and what is their relative strength:
(i) correlations among different LFV  $\tau$ decay rates~\cite{Celis:2014asa}; 
(ii)  differential distributions in higher multiplicity decays, such as the $\pi \pi$ invariant mass in 
$\tau \to \mu \pi \pi$ ~\cite{Celis:2014asa} 
and the Dalitz plot in $\tau \to 3 \mu$~\cite{Dassinger:2007ru,Matsuzaki:2007hh}.

%In this arena,  
In addition to Belle-II, 
HL/HE LHC will be able 
%competitive 
to search for 
the``background-free"   $\tau \to 3 \mu$.  
A detailed summary of projected sensitivities is given below. This is a particularly crucial discovery mode when LFV is introduced at tree-level,
for example by the exchange of $Z'$ or doubly charged Higgs bosons.
%projected sensitivity of $3.7 \times 10^{-9}$ at 90\% C.L. with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ at 14 TeV for CMS presented below. 
Efforts should also go into understanding the 
backgrounds and improving the sensitivity in semi-leptonic three-body decays $\tau  \to \mu \pi^+ \pi^-$ 
and $\tau \to \mu K \bar{K}$, which have a particularly high discovery potential in Higgs-mediated~\cite{Paradisi:2005tk,Celis:2013xja} or leptoquark-mediated LFV.
If LFV is discovered, these modes also have significant model-diagnosing power because of their Dalitz structure, and therefore also probe a wider class of models than the dominant one-loop-induced LFV process $\tau \to \mu \gamma$. Of particular interest is the sensitivity of $\tau \to \mu \pi \pi$ to extended Higgs sectors and to non-standard Yukawa couplings of the SM Higgs to light quarks and leptons~\cite{Celis:2013xja,Celis:2014asa}. This channel also allows a particularly robust theoretical interpretation thanks to advances in the calculation of all the relevant hadronic form factors~\cite{Celis:2013xja}.

The LHC proton collisions at 13 TeV produce $\tau$ leptons with a cross-section five orders of magnitude 
larger than at \belletwo. As a result, during the HL-LHC running period, about $10^ {15}$~$\tau$~leptons will be produced in 4$\pi$. Most will be
produced in the decay of heavy flavour hadrons, specifically $D_s$ meson decays.
%The event selection requires trimuons to form a good-quality trimuon vertex that should be displaced with respect to the primary pp-interaction point and uses a number of other observables to help suppress background.
This high production cross-section compensates for the higher background levels 
and lower integrated luminosity, in particular for the $\tau \to 3\mu$ golden mode.
Background events arise dominantly from badly reconstructed heavy flavour decays like \Dsetamunu, lepton fakes from hadrons ($c\bar{c}/b\bar{b}\to X\mu\mu$), and pile-up. A particular challenge for this production channel is the soft momentum spectrum of the $\tau$ decay products, which places stringent requirements on both the trigger and offline reconstructions of all the HL-LHC experiments.
%The muons originating from the .

$W$~and $Z$~bosons offer a complementary source of $\tau$  leptons. Their production cross sections are considerably smaller than those for $B$~and $D$~mesons, but $\tau$~leptons from $W$~and $Z$~afford much cleaner experimental signatures with far better signal-to-background ratios for CMS and ATLAS; the LHCb forward geometry is less well suited to exploting these decays. For instance, in a $\tau \to 3 \mu$ search relying on $W \to \tau \nu$ decays as a source of $\tau$~leptons, one can benefit from $\tau$~leptons having relatively large transverse momenta and being isolated, from large missing transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ in an event, and from the transverse mass of the $\tau$-$p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ system being close to the $W$~mass.

Detector improvements planned for the HL-LHC period will significantly enhance the capabilities of all three experiments in this area. In the case of ATLAS, the installation of a new tracking system will improve the vertex and momentum resolution. The trigger system upgrade will include additional capabilities, ultimately improving the online selection, and allowing to maintain a low muon triggering threshold. 
The CMS upgraded  muon system, whose coverage is extended from $|\eta|$ = 2.4 to ~2.8,  increases  
the signal fiducial acceptance by a factor of two and, also, enhances the capability to trigger on and reconstruct low momentum muons \cite{CMSTDR:muon}.
The additional events with muons at high $|\eta|$ have worse trimuon mass resolution. Hence, two event categories are introduced: 
Category 1 for events with all three muons reconstructed only with the Phase-1 detectors, and Category 2 for
events with at least one muon 
%with at least one muon 
reconstructed by the new triple GEM detectors, which  will be installed in the first station of the upgraded muon system. The impact of the proposed ATLAS detector upgrades and CMS event categories is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mass}. In the case of LHCb, the deployment of a fully software trigger will remove one of the key sources of inefficiency in the current analysis. In addition, the proposed calorimeter improvements during the LHCb \upgradetwo  will play an important role in suppressing backgrounds such as \Dsetamunu.

The extrapolated sensitivities for ATLAS and CMS as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:limits} and Tables~\ref{tab:limitsatlas}~and~\ref{tab:limitscms}.
The ATLAS sensitivities are extrapolated based on the Run~1 
measurement~\cite{Aad:2016wce} taking into account the expected detector 
improvements. Three scenarios for the acceptance, 
efficiency and background yields are considered.
Systematic uncertainties are extrapolated from the Run-1 measurement 
scaling down by the increased statistics with preserved constant terms for the 
reconstruction efficiency. A 15\% systematic uncertainty dominated by the background 
estimation is derived. Varying the systematic uncertainty by 5\% translates into a 
10\% change of the expected upper limit. Limits of up to $\BR(\tau\rightarrow 3\mu) = 
1.03 (5.36) \times 10^{-9}$ are derived in the HF-($W$-)channel.
In the case of CMS, the absence of tails in the signal trimuon mass distribution, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mass}, demonstrates the robustness of the reconstruction even at the high pileup (PU=200) of HL-LHC.
The projected exclusion sensitivity in the absence of a signal is $\BR( \tau \to 3 \mu) < 3.7 \times 10^{-9}$  at 90\% CL, while the expected 5 $\sigma$-observation sensitivity is $\BR(\tau \to 3 \mu) = 1.1  \times 10^{-8}$. CMS studies focusing on $\tau$~leptons originating from $W$~boson decays are ongoing.

Extrapolations based on the current LHCb $\tau \to 3\mu$ result~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-052} and assuming no detector or trigger improvements show that, similarly to \belletwo, CMS, and ATLAS, \upgradetwo LHCb would also be able to probe branching ratios down to ${\cal O}(10^{-9})$. This will allow \upgradetwo LHCb to independently confirm any earlier \belletwo discovery, or to
significantly improve the combined limit.

Of considerable  interest are also the LFV decay modes of $Z^0$. In the SM one has, due to nonzero neutrino masses,  
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\BR(Z \to e^\pm \mu^\mp)  \sim \BR(Z \to e^\pm \tau^\mp) \sim 10^{-54}, \qquad \BR(Z \to \mu^\pm \tau^\mp) \sim 10^{-60},
\end{eqnarray}

The current upper limits are due to LEP measurements (at 95\% CL)~\cite{Decamp:1991uy,Adriani:1993sy,Akers:1995gz,Abreu:1996mj},
\begin{equation}
%&&
\BR(Z \to e^\pm \mu^\mp) < 1.7\times 10^{-6},
% \\ &&
\quad \BR(Z \to e^\pm \tau^\mp)< 9.8\times 10^{-6}, 
%\\
%&&
\quad\BR(Z \to \mu^\pm \tau^\mp) < 1.2 \times 10^{-5},
\end{equation} 
Interestingly enough, the LHC can obtain competitive bounds on some of these channels~\cite{Davidson:2012wn}. 
%Indeed r
Recently the ATLAS Collaboration obtained the following 95\% CL upper limits: $\BR(Z \to e^\pm \tau^\mp)< 5.8  \times 10^{-5}$~\cite{Aaboud:2018cxn}, and $\BR(Z \to \mu^\pm \tau^\mp) <1.3  \times 10^{-5}$~\cite{Aaboud:2018cxn}. 
The HL/HE LHC will therefore provide the best limit on LFV $Z$ decays. 
The detection of a signal in the $Z^0 \to \ell \ell^\prime$ channel, in combination with the
information from charged lepton LFV decays,  
would also allow one to learn about features of the underlying LFV dynamics. 
An explicit example is provided by the Inverse Seesaw (ISS) and ``3+1"  effective models 
which add one or more sterile neutrinos to the particle content of the SM~\cite{Abada:2014nwa} (see also, e.g., Ref.~\cite{DeRomeri:2016gum}).
