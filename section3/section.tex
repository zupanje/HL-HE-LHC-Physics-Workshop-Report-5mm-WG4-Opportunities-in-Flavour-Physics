\section{Charm quark probes of new physics}
{\bf Author(s): J. Brod, A. Lenz, S. Fajfer, A. Kagan, L. Silvestrini} (15 pages, TH:EXP= 50\%:50\%)

%In the SM, the dynamics of FCNC processes is determined by the interplay between loop functions
%and CKM matrix elements. 
In the SM, the FCNC processes involving charmed hadrons are
suppressed compared to those involving strange or beauty hadrons since they are proportional to 
the soft breaking of the GIM mechanism by the bottom quark mass. This also means that 
 the contributions from long-distance physics, due to intermediate $d$, $s$ quarks, are relatively more important, complicating the predictions. 
%same reason, the prediction of these processes is generally
%complicated by a large contribution of long-distance

Moreover, due to small off-diagonal CKM matrix elements the third generation approximately factorizes from the first two generations, 
leading to additional suppression of the CP violating effects in charmed hadrons.

%suppressed by an approximate factorization of ,
%. 
The charmed
hadrons can then be used as sensitive probes of new physics in the up-quark
sector, to the extent that theoretical uncertainties can be brought
under control, or circumvented by using experimental data.

\subsection{Charm mixing}
\label{sec:Dmixingth}
Weak interactions mix $D^0$ and $\bar D^0$ mesons, so that the mass 
%Diagonalisation of the 2x2 Hamiltonian matrix, $H$, describing the mixing of the neutral $D$ mesons
%gives the same eigenvalue equations as in the neutral $B$ systems.  
%The mass 
eigenstates are
%denoted as 
$|D_{1,2}\rangle = p |D^0 \rangle \pm q |\dzbar\rangle$. By convention $|D_{2}\rangle$
is CP-even in the absence of CP violation.  The mass and width differences, 
$\Delta M = m_2 - m_1$, and $\Delta \Gamma = \Gamma_2 - \Gamma_1$,  are parametrized as 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{xyexp}
x \equiv \Delta M^D / \Gamma^D = 0.46 \% \pm 0.13 \% \, ,
&&
y \equiv \Delta \Gamma^D / (2 \Gamma^D) = 0.62 \% \pm 0.07 \%.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\Gamma$ is the total decay rate of the neutral $D$ mesons, while the numerical values are from the fits to the experimental measurements \cite{Amhis:2016xyh}.
% are also included. 
% While a decay rate difference in the neutral $D$ system is by now firmly established, the possibility of 
% having a vanishing mass difference is not yet experimentally excluded (the future sensitivity for $x$
% will be at the order of $0.001 \%$).  
% However, as discussed below, $x\sim y$ is naturally expected
% in the SM \cite{Falk:2001hx,Falk:2004wg,Cheng:2010rv}.
This is to be contrasted with the $B$ system, where $|\Gamma_{12}/M_{12}| \ll 1$ holds.
We also define the ``theoretical'' mixing parameters, 
\beq 
x_{12}\, \equiv\, \frac{2|M^D_{12}|}{\Gamma^D}\,
,~~ y_{12}\, \equiv\,\frac{|\Gamma^D_{12}|}{\Gamma^D}\,,~~\phi_{12} \,\equiv\, {\rm arg}\left(\frac{M^D_{12}}{\Gamma^D_{12} }\right)\,,
\label{x12yi12phi12}
\eeq
where $M_{12}^D $ and $\Gamma_{12}^D$ are the dispersive and absorptive contributions to the $\DDbar$ mixing amplitude, $\langle  D^0 | H | \dzbar \rangle \ =\  M^D_{12} - \frac{i}{2} \Gamma^D_{12}$. 
The phase $\phi_{12}$ gives rise to CP violation in mixing, cf. Sec.~\ref{sec:CPVDmixth}. Its magnitude is currently bounded to lie below $\sim 100$ mrad at 95\% CL~\cite{LHCbimplications,Amhis:2016xyh}.
These parameters are related to $x$ and $y$ as,
\beq (x- i y)^2 = x_{12}^2 - y_{12}^2  - 2 \,i\, x_{12} y_{12} \cos\phi_{12}\,,\label{xyx12y12}\eeq
so that, up to negligible corrections quadratic in $\sin\phi_{12}$ (in general, $|y| \le y_{12}$ \cite{Nierste:2009wg,Jubb:2016mvq}),
\beq \begin{split} |x|=x_{12} ,~~|y| = y_{12}\,.\label{x12vsx}
\end{split}
\eeq 


It is convenient to begin the discussion of the SM mixing amplitudes 
%(and indirect CPV, cf. Sec.~\ref{sec:CPVDmixth}) 
with their $U$-spin flavor symmetry decomposition \cite{Falk:2001hx,Gronau:2012kq}.
Employing CKM unitarity, $\lambda_d + \lambda_s +\lambda_b = 0$, with  $\lambda_x = V_{cx} V^*_{ux}$, 
$\Gamma^D_{12}$ can be written as 
\beq
 \Gamma^D_{12 } = \frac{(\lambda_s - \lambda_d )^2}{4 }\, \Gamma_2 + \frac{(\lambda_s - \lambda_d ){\lambda_b} }{ 2 }\, \Gamma_1 + 
\frac{{ \lambda_b^2} }{4} \, \Gamma_0 \,,  \label{Uspindecomp}\eeq
where
\beq \begin{split} \label{Uspinamps}
\Gamma_2  &= \Gamma_{ss} + \Gamma_{dd} - 2 \Gamma_{sd} ~\sim~ (\bar s s - \bar d d )^2 ={\mathcal O}(\epsilon^2)  \,,\cr
\Gamma_1 & = \Gamma_{ss} - \Gamma_{dd}~ \sim~ (\bar s s - \bar d d ) (\bar s s + \bar d d) ={\mathcal O}(\epsilon)\,,\cr
\Gamma_0 & = \Gamma_{ss} +\Gamma_{dd}+2 \Gamma_{sd} ~ \sim~ (\bar s s+ \bar d d )^2 ={\mathcal O}(1)  \,,
\end{split}
\eeq
with $\epsilon$ the $U$-spin breaking parameter. 
%and similarly for the dispersive parts with $\Gamma\to M$ replacements everywhere.
 The $\Gamma_{2,1,0}$ are the $\Delta U_3 =0$ elements of the $U$-spin 5-plet, triplet, and singlet, respectively.
%$\Delta U$= 2, 1, 0 (5-plet, triplet, and singlet)  multiplets, respectively.  
%This can be seen from their quark flavor structure, given by
%where t
The individual $\Gamma_{ij}$ are identified, at the quark level, with box diagrams containing on-shell internal $i$ and $j$ quarks. They possess flavor structure $\Gamma_{ij}\sim  (\bar i i) (\bar j j) (\bar u c)^2$, where
the external $u $ and $c$ quarks are irrelevant for the $U$-spin decomposition.
%The orders in the $U$-spin breaking parameter $\epsilon$ at which they enter are shown on the right (corresponding to the power of the 
%$U$-spin breaking spurion $ \epsilon (\bar s s - \bar d d)$ required to construct each $\Gamma_i$).  
The $U$-spin decomposition of $M^D_{12}$ is analogous to \eqref{Uspindecomp}, with $\Gamma\to M$ replacement everywhere. 
%with the $M_i$ given by 
%\beq \begin{split} \label{Mspinamps}
%M_2  &= M_{ss} +M_{dd} - 2 M_{sd} ~\sim~ (\bar s s - \bar d d )^2 
%=O(\epsilon^2)  \,,\cr
%M_1 & =M_{ss} - M_{dd} + M_{sb} - M_{db} ~ \sim~ (\bar s s - \bar d d ) (\bar s s + \bar d d) =O(\epsilon)\,,\cr
%M_0 & =M_{ss} +M_{dd}+2 M_{sd} + M_{sb} + M_{db} + M_{bb} ~ \sim~ (\bar s s+ \bar d d )^2 =O(1)  \,.
%\end{split}
%\eeq
%The $M_{ij} $ are ``off-shell" analogs of the $\Gamma_{ij}$.
At the level of quark box diagrams, $M_{1,0}$ also receive contributions containing internal $b$ quarks.
The small value of $\lambda_b$ implies that we can neglect the $\Delta U= 1, 0$ contributions to the mass and width differences, even though the $\Delta U=2$ piece is higher order in $\epsilon$.



Evaluation of the SM mixing amplitudes is very challenging,
because the charm quark mass lies at an intermediate scale between the masses of the light quarks and the bottom quark.
%the heavy quark expansion (HQE) applies, and and chiral perturbation theory.  
%, too light to be considered a heavy quark not much larger than $\Lambda_{QCD}$.  
Broadly, there are two approaches: (i) an inclusive one employing the operator product expansion (OPE), which expands in powers of $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_c$, as in the heavy quark expansion (HQE), and assumes that local quark-hadron duality holds \cite{Georgi:1992as,Ohl:1992sr,Bigi:2000wn,Bobrowski:2010xg}; and (ii) 
an exclusive one in which $y$ is estimated by summing over contributions of exclusive states, and $x$ is estimated via a dispersion relation which relates
it to $y$.
In the first approach, 
the HQE applied to $\Gamma_{12}^D$, combined with the relevant non-perturbative dimension six operator matrix elements evaluated in 
\cite{Carrasco:2014uya,Carrasco:2015pra,Bazavov:2017weg,Kirk:2017juj}, yields
contributions of the individual $\Gamma_{ij}$ %, e.g. $\Gamma_{ss}$, 
to $y$ that are five times larger than the experimental value \cite{Lenz:2016fcv}.
This corresponds to $\Gamma_{ij} \sim \Gamma^D$, which is not surprising, given that the HQE can accommodate the charm meson lifetimes
\cite{Lenz:2013aua,Kirk:2017juj}.
However, the result for $\Gamma_2$, cf. \eqref{Uspindecomp}, \eqref{Uspinamps}, yields a value of $y$
%$s\bar s the whole expression of Eq.(\ref{Gamma12D}) one lies 
lying about four orders 
of magnitude below experiment, due to large GIM-cancellations between the $\Gamma_{ij} $ contributions.
Evidently, the inclusive approach is not well suited for analyzing the $U$-spin breaking responsible for $\DDbar$ mixing, i.e., the charm quark is not sufficiently massive.
First estimates 
of the dimension nine contribution in the HQE \cite{Bobrowski:2012jf} indicate an enhancement compared to the leading dimension six terms, but do not alter this conclusion.  The HQE result $\theta_c^2 \Gamma_{ij}\sim 5 \,y $ would require 
large $U$-spin violation, i.e. 





In a fit to the data which supplements the OPE with a $U$-spin breaking model for duality violation \cite{Jubb:2016mvq}, the latter yields ${\mathcal O}(20\%)$ corrections to the $\Gamma_{ij}$, corresponding to $\epsilon^2 = O(20\%)$ in $\Gamma_2$, cf. \eqref{Uspinamps}.


further supporting the need for a non-perturbative description of $\DDbar$ mixing. % in the SM.
One possibility is the second (exclusive) approach.



The starting point for the exclusive approach\cite{Falk:2001hx,Falk:2004wg,Cheng:2010rv,Gronau:2012kq,Jiang:2017zwr} 
%aims to determine $M_{12}^D$ and  $\Gamma_{12}^D$ at the hadron level. A potential starting point 
is a sum over the decay modes contributing to the absorptive and dispersive mixing amplitudes,
\beq
\Gamma_{12}^D =  \sum_f \rho_f                                            A_f^* \, \bar A_f  \, ;
~~~~~M_{12}^D  =   \langle {D}^0 | H |\dzbar \rangle 
+ P \sum_f{}^{\prime} \frac{    A_f^* \, \bar A_f  }
                                          {m_{D^0}^2 - E_f^2} \, ,
\label{Dmix_exclusive}
\eeq
where $A_f $ and $\bar A_f $ are the $D^0 \to f$ and $\dzbar \to f$ decay amplitudes, respectively, $\sum$ ($\sum^\prime$) denotes a sum over all on-shell (off-shell) hadronic states $f$ into which both the $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ can decay, $\rho_f$ is the 
density of the state $f$, and $P$ is the principal value.   Unfortunately, the charm quark mass is not sufficiently light
for $D$ meson decays to be dominated by a few final states.  Moreover, the off-shell decay amplitudes
and strong phase differences entering the above expressions %are not directly measurable, and 
are not calculable from first principles.  
Thus, simplified treatments of $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry breaking have been utilized.
%(recall that the mixing amplitudes vanish in the symmetric limit, cf.~\eqref{Uspindecomp}--\eqref{Mspinamps}).  
A rough $U$-spin based estimate for $y$ is simply obtained from the first term in \eqref{Uspindecomp}, 
\beq y \,= \, \sin^2 \theta_c \times  \Gamma_2/ \Gamma^D\, \sim \,\sin^2\theta_C \,\times \, \epsilon^2  \sim (0.2 -5)\%,\eeq
where we have taken $\Gamma_2 \sim \Gamma^D \epsilon^2 $; and 
$\epsilon \sim 0.2 - 1$, corresponding to variation from nominal to maximal $U$-spin breaking.
The authors of \cite{Falk:2001hx,Falk:2004wg} only took $SU(3)_F$-breaking phase space effects into account in the exclusive sum.  They found that 
$y\lsim 1\%$ could naturally be realized, where a value at the high end would require contributions from higher multiplicity final states, due to larger $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects near threshold.
This conclusion was subsequently supported in \cite{Cheng:2010rv,Jiang:2017zwr}, which added experimental branching ratio inputs together with factorization based models for dynamical $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects, e.g., in the form factors and strong phases.
Rough dispersion relation treatments relating $x$ to $y$ in \cite{Falk:2004wg,Cheng:2010rv } suggested that $|x/y| \sim 0.1 -1$.


We conclude that the estimates of $x$ and $y$ in the SM are consistent with their measured values, cf. \eqref{xyexp}.  
Unfortunately, the large theoretical uncertainties eliminate the window for NP in these quantities. % is currently closed due to the large theoretical uncertainties.
The situation is markedly different for the CPV mixing observables, due to their large suppression in the SM, as discussed below.
On a very long time-scale, direct lattice calculations might be able to predict the
SM values of $x$ and $y$ by building on the methods described in \cite{Hansen:2012tf}.


% Diagonalisation of the 2x2 matrix describing the mixing of the neutral $D$ mesons
% gives the same Eigenwert equations like in the neutral $B$ systems:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \Delta M_D^2 - \frac14 \Delta \Gamma_D^2 
% =  
% 4 \left| M_{12}^D \right|^2 - \left| \Gamma_{12}^D \right|^2 \, ,
% &&
% \Delta M_D \Delta \Gamma_D 
%  =  
% 4 \left| M_{12}^D \right| \left| \Gamma_{12}^D \right| \cos (\phi_{12}^D) \, ,
% \label{xyrelns} \end{eqnarray}
% with the mass difference $\Delta M_D$ and decay rate difference $ \Delta \Gamma_D$ of the mass 
% eigenstates of the neutral $D$ mesons. The box diagrams giving rise to $D$ mixing can have internal
% $d$, $s$ and $b$ quarks - compared to $u$, $c$, $t$ in the $B$ sector. $M_{12}^D$ denotes the 
% dispersive part of the box diagram, $\Gamma_{12}^D$ the absorptive part and the relative phase 
% of the two is given by $\phi_{12}^D = - \arg (-M_{12}^D / \Gamma_{12}^D)$. Unlike in the $B$ 
% system, where $|\Gamma_{12}/M_{12}| \ll 1$ holds, the expressions for  $\Delta M_D$ and 
% $\Delta \Gamma_D$ in terms of $M_{12}^D$ and $\Gamma_{12}^D$ cannot be simplified,  
% and for the knowledge of $\Delta M_D$ both $M_{12}^D$ and $\Gamma_{12}^D$ have to be determined. 
% On the other hand it is well-known that bounds like $\Delta \Gamma_D \leq 2 |\Gamma_{12}^D |$ 
% hold \cite{Nierste:2009wg,Jubb:2016mvq}.
% The experimental measurements \cite{Amhis:2016xyh} of the mass and decay rate differences 
% yield very small values
% \begin{eqnarray}\label{xyexp}
% x := \Delta M_D / \Gamma_D = 0.32 \% \pm 0.14 \% \, ,
% &&
% y := \Delta \Gamma_D / (2 \Gamma_D) = 0.61 \% \pm 0.07 \% \, ,
% \end{eqnarray}
% where $\Gamma_D$ denotes the total decay rate of the neutral $D$ mesons. While
% a decay rate difference in the neutral $D$ system is by now firmly established, the possibility of 
% having a vanishing mass difference is still not excluded - the future experimental sensitivity for $x$
% will be at the order of $0.001 \%$.
% \\
% $\Gamma_{12}^D$ can be expressed in terms of on-shell box diagrams differing in the 
% internal quarks - $(s \bar{s})$, $(s \bar{d})$, $(d \bar{s})$ and $(d \bar{d})$.
% Using the unitarity ($\lambda_d + \lambda_s +\lambda_b = 0$ with  $\lambda_x = V_{cx} V^*_{ux}$) of the CKM matrix \cite{Cabibbo:1963yz,Kobayashi:1973fv} one gets
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \Gamma_{12}^D & = & -   \lambda_s^2 \left(\Gamma_{ss}^D - 2 \Gamma_{sd}^D + \Gamma_{dd}^D\right)
%                     + 2 \lambda_s \lambda_b \left(\Gamma_{sd}^D - \Gamma_{dd}^D \right)
%                     -   \lambda_b^2 \Gamma_{dd}^D \, .
% \label{Gamma12D}
% \end{eqnarray}
% Eq.(\ref{Gamma12D}) shows a very pronounced CKM hierarchy: 
% expressed in terms of the Wolfenstein parameter \cite{Wolfenstein:1983yz} $\lambda \approx 0.225$ 
% (web-updates of \cite{Charles:2004jd,Bona:2006ah}) one has $\lambda_s \propto \lambda$ 
% and $\lambda_b \propto \lambda^5$. 
% In the exact $SU(3)_F$ limit $\Gamma_{ss}^D = \Gamma_{sd}^D = \Gamma_{dd}^D$ holds and 
% the first two terms of the r.h.s. of Eq.(\ref{Gamma12D}) vanish and only the tiny contribution from 
% the third term survives. 
% The determination of $M_{12}^D$ involves in addition box diagrams with internal $b$ 
% quarks and in contrast to $\Gamma_{12}^D$ now the dispersive part of the diagrams has 
% to be determined. Denoting the dispersive part of a box diagram with internal $x$ and $y$ 
% quarks by $M_{xy}^D$ and using again CKM unitarity one gets the following structure
% \begin{eqnarray}
% M_{12}^D \! & \! = \! &  \! \! \! \lambda_s^2          \left[ M_{ss}^D \! - 2 M_{sd}^D + M_{dd}^D \right]
%               \! + 2 \lambda_s \lambda_b  \left[ M_{bs}^D \! -   M_{bd}^D \! - M_{sd}^D + M_{dd}^D \right]
%               \!+   \lambda_b^2          \left[ M_{bb}^D \! - 2 M_{bd}^D + M_{dd}^D \right]\, .
% \label{M12D}
% \end{eqnarray} 
% In the case of neutral $B$ mesons the third term (replacing $b,s,d \to t,c,u$) is clearly dominant, while in the case 
% of $D$ mesons the extreme CKM suppression of $\lambda_b$ might be compensated by a less pronounced 
% GIM cancellation \cite{Glashow:1970gm} and in the end all three contributions of 
% Eq.(\ref{M12D}) could have a similar size.
% For the theoretical determination of $M_{12}^D$ and $\Gamma_{12}^D$ one can use a 
% quark-level (inclusive) or a hadron-level (exclusive) description. 
% The inclusive approach for $\Gamma_{12}^D$ is based on the heavy quark expansion (HQE) 
% \cite{Khoze:1983yp,Shifman:1984wx,Bigi:1991ir,Bigi:1992su,Blok:1992hw,Blok:1992he,Beneke:1998sy} and 
% works very well for the $B$ system \cite{Lenz:2014jha,Artuso:2015swg,Kirk:2017juj}.
% Surprisingly the HQE can successfully explain the large lifetime ratio of charm mesons 
% \cite{Lenz:2013aua,Kirk:2017juj} indicating an expansion parameter $\Lambda/m_c \approx 0.3$. 
% Lifetimes have the advantages of being free from GIM cancellations - to make statements concerning 
% the convergence of the HQE in the charm system more sound, future experimental and theoretical 
% studies of charmed baryon lifetimes will be necessary.
% Applying the HQE (the appearing non-perturbative matrix elements of dimension six operators have been
% determined in \cite{Carrasco:2014uya,Carrasco:2015pra,Bazavov:2017weg,Kirk:2017juj}) to 
% a single diagram contributing to $\Gamma_{12}^D$ - e.g. only internal
% $s \bar{s}$ quark - one gets five times the experimental value of $y$ \cite{Lenz:2016fcv}, 
% applying the HQE to the whole expression of Eq.(\ref{Gamma12D}) one lies about four orders 
% of magnitude below the experiment! Due to the success of the HQE in the $B$ system (where the 
% expansion parameter is only a factor of three smaller) and for $D$ meson lifetimes 
% it is unlikely that the HQE fails by four orders of magnitude in charm mixing - the problem seems
% to be rooted in severe GIM cancellations.
% In \cite{Jubb:2016mvq} it was shown that duality violations of the order of $20 \%$ could be 
% sufficient to explain the discrepancy. Another interesting idea 
% \cite{Georgi:1992as,Ohl:1992sr,Bigi:2000wn,Bobrowski:2010xg}
% is a lifting of the severe GIM cancellation in the first and second term of Eq.(\ref{Gamma12D})
% by higher terms in the HQE - overcompensating the $\Lambda/m_c$ suppression. First estimates 
% of the dimension nine contribution in the HQE for $D$ mixing \cite{Bobrowski:2012jf}
% indicate an enhancement compared to the leading dimension six terms, unfortunately not 
% large enough to explain the experimental value. Here a full theory determination of the HQE
% terms of dimension nine and twelve will provide further insight.
% It is interesting to note that the lifting of GIM cancellation in $D$-mixing by higher orders in the 
% HQE \cite{Georgi:1992as,Ohl:1992sr,Bigi:2000wn,Bobrowski:2010xg} could also yield a sizeable 
% CP violating phase in $\Gamma_{12}$, stemming from the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq.(\ref{Gamma12D}).
% According to \cite{Bobrowski:2010xg} values of up to $1 \%$ for $\phi_{12}^D$ can currently not be excluded.
% After settling the issues with the inclusive theory prediction for $\Gamma_{12}^D$ one could aim for
% a quark level determination of $M_{12}^D$.
% \\
% The exclusive approach\cite{Falk:2001hx,Falk:2004wg,Cheng:2010rv,Jiang:2017zwr} 
% aims to determine $M_{12}^D$ and  $\Gamma_{12}^D$ at the hadron level. A potential starting point are the expressions
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \Gamma_{12}^D & = & \sum \limits_n \rho_n \langle \bar{D}^0 | {\cal H}_{eff.}^{\Delta C =1} | n   \rangle
%                                           \langle  n        | {\cal H}_{eff.}^{\Delta C =1} | D^0 \rangle \, ,
% \\
% M_{12}^D & = & \sum \limits_n \langle \bar{D}^0 | {\cal H}_{eff.}^{\Delta C =2} |D^0 \rangle 
% + P \sum \limits_n \frac{ \langle \bar{D}^0 | {\cal H}_{eff.}^{\Delta C =1} | n   \rangle
%                                           \langle  n        | {\cal H}_{eff.}^{\Delta C =1} | D^0 \rangle }
%                                           {m_D^2 - E_n^2} \, ,
% \label{Dmix_exclusive}
% \end{eqnarray}
% where $n$ denotes all possible hadronic states in which both $D^0$ and$\bar{D}^0$ can decay into, $\rho_n$ is the 
% density of the state $n$ and $P$ is the principal value. Unfortunately a first principle calculation 
% of the arising matrix elements is beyond our current abilities, thus we have to make simplifying 
% assumptions like taking only the $SU(3)_F$-breaking effects due to phase space effects into account
% and neglecting any other hadronic effects. Doing so the authors of \cite{Falk:2001hx,Falk:2004wg} 
% found that $y$ and $x$ could naturally be of the order of a per cent. On the other hand such a treatment 
% clearly does not allow to draw strong conclusions about the existence of BSM effects, if the 
% measurement would disagree with these expectations.  The exclusive approach can be improved by 
% using experimental input, as done in \cite{Cheng:2010rv}, or by trying to take into account 
% additional dynamical effects compared to the phase space. In  \cite{Jiang:2017zwr} the
% factorization-assisted topological-amplitude approach was used for this purpose.
% On a very long time-scale also direct lattice calculations might also be able to predict the
% SM values for $D$-mixing by building up on methods described in \cite{Hansen:2012tf}.

% mention window for NP here unlike in the CP conserving obseravbles x, y
In the SM, CP violation (CPV) in $\DDbar$ mixing is highly suppressed, entering at 
{ ${\mathcal O}(|V_{cb} V_{ub} / V_{cs} V_{us}| ) \sim 10^{-3}$}. 
This raises several questions, which we briefly address, based on work to appear in \cite{GKLPPS}:
What is the resulting theoretical uncertainty on the indirect CPV 
observables? How large is the current window for New Physics (NP)?  
What is an appropriate parametrization for indirect CPV effects, 
given the expected sensitivity in the LHCb/Belle-II era?   


There are two types of CPV due to mixing; both are referred to 
as ``indirect'' CPV.  The first is CPV due to interference between the dispersive and absorptive mixing amplitudes (``CPVMIX''), which arises when $\phi_{12}\ne 0$.  CPVMIX can be directly measured via 
the semileptonic CP asymmetry 
\beq \label{ASL}
A_{\rm SL} \ \equiv\  
\frac{\Gamma(D^0\to K^+\ell^-\nu) - \Gamma(\dzbar\to K^-\ell^+\nu)}
{\Gamma(D^0\to K^+\ell^-\nu) + \Gamma(\dzbar\to K^-\ell^+\nu)} \ =\ 
 \frac{|q/p|^4 -1}{|q/p|^4 +1}\ = \frac{2 x_{12} y_{12}}{x_{12}^2 + y_{12}^2 } \sin\phi_{12}\,.
\eeq
The second type of indirect CPV is due to interference between a direct decay 
amplitude and a ``mixed'' amplitude followed by decay (``CPVINT''), 
i.e., interference between $D^0 \to f$ and $D^0 \to \dzbar \to f $. 
For decays to a CP eigenstate final state, there are two CPVINT observables
%, introduced in
\cite{Branco:1999fs}, 
\beq 
\lambda^M_{f} \equiv \,\frac{M_{12}}{|M_{12} |}\,
\frac{A_f } { \overline A_f} = \,\eta_{f}^{CP}\,\left|\frac{A_f }{ \overline A_f }\right| \, e^{ i  \phi_f^M }\,,~~~
\lambda^\Gamma_{f} \equiv \,\frac{\Gamma_{12} }{|\Gamma_{12} |}\,
\frac{A_f } {\overline A_f} = \,\eta_{f}^{CP}\,\left|\frac{A_f } {\overline A_f}\right| \, e^{ i  \phi_f^\Gamma }
   \,,\label{lambdaMf}\eeq   
parametrizing the interference for a dispersive and absorptive mixing amplitudes, respectively.
The $\phi^{M}_f$ and $\phi^{\Gamma}_f$ are CPV weak phases, with $\phi_{12} = \phi_{f}^M - \phi_{f}^\Gamma$,  while $\eta_f^{CP} = + (-)$ for CP even (odd) final states. 
%For decays to a CP-conjugate pair of final states $f$ and $\bar f$,
%there are two pairs of observables analogous to \eqref{lambdaMf}, which depend on the weak phases $\phi^{M}_f$ and $\phi^{\Gamma}_f$, as well as the strong phase difference between $A_f $ and $ \overline A_f $.
%The absorptive and dispersive phases satisfy $\phi_{12} = \phi_{f}^M - \phi_{f}^\Gamma$.
%\beq \phi_{12} = \phi_{f}^M - \phi_{f}^\Gamma \,.\label{phiMfmphiGf}\eeq
In general, $\phi^{M}_f$ and $\phi^{\Gamma}_f$ 
are final-state specific due 
to non-universal weak and strong phases entering the CKM suppressed SM 
(and potential NP) contributions to the subleading decay amplitudes. 


Non-vanishing $\phi^{M}_f$ and $\phi^\Gamma_f$
yield {\it time-dependent} CP asymmetries. For example, in singly Cabibbo suppressed (SCS) decays to 
CP-eigenstates, $f=K^+K^-,\,\pi^+ \pi^-,...$, the effective decay widths, $\hat{\Gamma}$, for $D^0$ and
$\dzbar$ decays will differ,
\beq 
\Delta Y_f \ \equiv\ 
\frac{\hat \Gamma^{}_{\dzbar \to f} - \hat \Gamma^{}_{D^0 \to f}} {2 \Gamma_D}
\ = \,- x_{12} \sin\phi_f^M  + a_f^d \, y_{12} \,.
\label{eqn:scs_asymm1}
\eeq
%where $\Delta Y_f = - A_\Gamma$.
The first and second terms on the RHS are the dispersive CPVINT and direct CPV contributions, respectively, % (which is subleading, as we will see below), 
where the direct CP asymmetry is defined as $a_f^d = 1 - \left|\bar A_f / A_f \right|$. 
%\beq a_f^d = 1 - \left|\bar A_f / A_f \right| . \label{afdCP}\eeq
They can, in principle, be disentangled
via measurements of the corresponding time-integrated CP asymmetries \eqref{ACPhh}, which satisfy $A_{CP} (D^0 \to h^+ h^-) = \Delta Y_{h^+ h^-} \,\langle t\rangle/ \tau^{}_D   +\ a_{h^+ h^-}^{d}$.
Examples of time-dependent CP asymmetries in decays to non-CP eigenstates include
the SCS final states $f=K^* K$ or $f=\rho\pi$, and the Cabibbo favored/doubly Cabibbo suppressed
(CF/DCS) final states $f=K^\pm \pi^\mp$.  These asymmetries generally depend on both $\phi_f^M$ and $\phi_f^\Gamma$, unlike decays to CP eigenstates, due to the additional strong phases \cite{GKLPPS}.
%difference between $A_f$ and $\overline A_f$.%$\Delta_f$ \cite{GKLPPS}.

The dispersive and absorptive observables are simply related \cite{GKLPPS} 
to the more familiar parametrization of indirect CPV, see, e.g., \cite{Nir:1992uv}. The latter consists 
of $ |q/p|-1 $, 
and  
\beq{\lambda_f} \equiv \frac{q}{p} \frac{ \bar A_f }{A_f} = - \eta_f^{ CP} \left|\lambda_f \right| e^{i \,\phi_{\lambda_f}},\label{lambdaf}\eeq
for CP eigenstate final states, and pairs of observables ${\lambda_f} $, $\lambda_{\bar f} $ 
for non-CP eigenstate final states.
The same number of independent parameters is employed in each case (recall that $\phi_{12} = \phi_f^M - \phi_f^\Gamma$).


% With the continuing improvements in experimental sensitivity at LHCb,  
Single mrad precision for $\phi_{12}$ could become a realistic target at LHCb, see below and Sec.~ \ref{sec:expcharmmix}, to be 
compared with the current $\sim 50-100$ mrad bounds 
[95\% CL] quoted by HFLAV and UTfit Collaboration~\cite{Amhis:2016xyh,LHCbimplications}. 
Thus, we must estimate the final state dependence in $\phi_f^M$, $\phi_f^\Gamma$
%(recall that $\phi_{12} = \phi_f^M-\phi_f^\Gamma$) 
due to the subleading decay amplitudes, and consider how to best parameterize this.
This is accomplished via the $U$-spin flavor symmetry decomposition of the $\DDbar$ mixing amplitudes given in Eq. \eqref{Uspindecomp}.
%--\eqref{Mspinamps}.
We define three theoretical CPV phases 
%with respect to ${\rm arg}[(\lambda_s - \lambda_d)^2]$, the direction of the $\Delta U=2$ contributions $\Gamma_2$, $M_2$ in the mixing amplitude complex plane,
\beq \label{theorphasesdef}
{ \phi_2^\Gamma }\equiv  {\rm arg}\left(\frac{\Gamma_{12}} {\Gamma_{12}^{\Delta U=2} }\right),~~{ \phi_2^M }\equiv  {\rm arg}\left(\frac{M_{12} }{\Gamma_{12}^{\Delta U=2} }\right),~~\phi_2 \equiv  {\rm arg}\left(\frac{q} { p} \frac{1}{\Gamma_{12}^{\Delta U=2} } \right)\,,
\eeq
%The phases $\phi_2^M$, $\phi_2^\Gamma$, and $\phi_2$ 
which are the theoretical analogs of the final state dependent phases $\phi_f^M$, $\phi_f^\Gamma$, and $\phi_{\lambda_f}
$, respectively.
The $U$-spin breaking hierarchy $\Gamma_1/ \Gamma_2 = {\mathcal O}(1/\epsilon)$ %cf. \eqref{Gamma12decomp}, 
yields
the estimate
\beq \begin{split} \label{theorphases}
{ \phi_2^\Gamma }&  \approx {\rm Im}\left(  \frac{2 \lambda_b }{ \lambda_s - \lambda_d}  \frac{\Gamma_1 }{\Gamma_2} \right)
\sim \left| \frac{\lambda_b }{ \theta_c } \right| \sin \gamma  \times \frac{1} { \epsilon},
\end{split}
\eeq
and similarly for $\phi_2^M$ (the $O(\lambda_b^2)$ contributions are negligible).
Taking the nominal value $\epsilon \sim 0.2$ for $U$-spin breaking, 
%and noting that $\phi_{12} =  \phi_2^M - \phi_2^\Gamma$,
% in \eqref{theorphases}, 
we obtain the rough 
SM estimates
\beq  \phi_{12} \sim \phi_2^\Gamma \sim \phi_2^M \sim 3 \times 10^{-3} 
\,.\label{phiGphiMnaive}\eeq
Comparison with the current 95\% CL bounds on $\phi_{12}$ 
implies that there is an ${\mathcal O}(10)$ window for NP in indirect CPV.
An alternative expression for $\phi_2^\Gamma$ follows from \eqref{theorphases} via the relation $\Gamma_2  \cong y \,\Gamma^D$, 
 \beq |\phi_2^\Gamma| =  \left|\frac{\sin\gamma\,\, \lambda_b\,\lambda_s 
} { y }\right| \,\frac{|\Gamma_1 |} { \Gamma^D } \approx 0.005 \, \frac{|\Gamma_1 |} { \Gamma^D } \sim 0.005\, \epsilon  \,,\label{refined}\eeq
where in the last relation we have taken $\Gamma_1 \sim \Gamma^D \epsilon$.
In principle, $\Gamma_1$ can be estimated via the exclusive approach as more data on SCS $D^0$ decay branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries becomes available.



The misalignments between $\phi_f^M$, $\phi_f^\Gamma$, $\phi_{\lambda_f}$ in \eqref{lambdaMf}, \eqref{lambdaf}, and their theoretical counterparts satisfy  %these phases, for given final state $f$, satisfy
\beq {{ \delta \phi_f } \equiv \phi_{f}^\Gamma - \phi_{2}^\Gamma = \phi_{f}^M - \phi_{2}^M  = \phi_2 -\phi_{\lambda_f}} \,.\eeq
We can characterize the magnitude of the misalignment $\delta \phi_f$ in the SM as follows:
(i) For CF/DCS decays it is precisely known and negligible, i.e., $\delta \phi_f = {\mathcal O}(\lambda_b^2 / \theta_c^2 )$;
(ii) In SCS decays, $\delta \phi_f$ is related to direct CPV as $\delta \phi_f = a_f^d  \,\cot \delta $
 via the $U$-spin decomposition of the decay amplitudes \cite{Brod:2012ud}, where
a strong phase $\delta = {\mathcal O}(1)$ is expected due to 
large rescattering at the charm mass scale.  Thus, for $f = \pi^+ \pi^-,\, K^+ K^-$,
the experimental bounds $a_f^d \lsim {\mathcal O}(10^{-3})$ imply that $\delta \phi_f \lsim {\mathcal O}(10^{-3})$; 
(iii) In SCS decays, $\delta \phi_f = {\mathcal O}( \lambda_b \sin\gamma /\theta_c ) \times \cot\delta$, i.e., it is ${\mathcal O}(1)$ in $SU(3)_F$ breaking.  Thus,
%at which quantities arise, find $\phi_{12}^\Gamma = O(1/\epsilon) $.  
\eqref{theorphases} yields ${\delta \phi_f  /\phi_{2}^\Gamma } = {\mathcal O}({ \epsilon})$,
implying an order of magnitude suppression of the misalignment. % relative to the 


%We learn that
In the LHCb era, 
% and assuming $\lsim 10$ mrad sensitivity
% , 
a single pair of dispersive and absorptive phases, identified with $\phi_2^M$ and  $\phi_2^\Gamma$, respectively, should suffice to parametrize all indirect CPV effects. We refer to this fortunate circumstance as {\it approximate universality}.  Moreover, approximate universality generalizes beyond the SM under the following conservative assumptions about NP %decay amplitudes containing new weak phases: 
contributions:
(i) they can be neglected in CF/DCS decays (a highly exotic NP flavor structure would otherwise be required in order to evade the $\epsilon_K$ constraint~\cite{Bergmann:1999pm}); (ii) in SCS decays they are of similar size or  
%magnitudes are similar to, or 
smaller than the SM QCD penguin amplitudes, as already hinted at by the experimental bounds on the direct CP asymmetries $a^d_{K^+K^-},\,a^d_{\pi^+\pi^-}$. These assumptions can be tested by future direct CPV measurements.


Under approximate universality, 
%the phases $\phi_f^M$ and $\phi_f^\Gamma$ are replaced with $\phi_2^M$ and $\phi_2^\Gamma$, respectively, 
$\phi_f^M\to \phi_2^M$ and $\phi_f^\Gamma\to\phi_2^\Gamma$
in expressions for time-dependent CP asymmetries. 
A global fit to the CPV data for any two of the three phases, 
$\phi_2^M$, $\phi_2^\Gamma$, $\phi_{12}$, is equivalent to the traditional
two-parameter fit for 
%the parameters 
$|q/p|$ and $ \phi$
, where $ \phi$ is identified with $\phi_2$~\cite{GKLPPS}.
The relations 
\beq
\left| \frac{q} { p}\right| -1   \approx  \frac{|x| |y| } { x^2 + y^2 } \sin{ \phi_{12}} ,~~~~~
\tan 2 (\phi_2 + { \phi^\Gamma})  \approx  - \frac{x_{12}^2 } { x_{12}^2 + y_{12}^2  }   
\sin 2{ \phi_{12}} \,,
\label{beyondsuperweak}
\eeq
together with $\phi_{12} = \phi_2^M - \phi_2^\Gamma$, allow one to translate between 
$(\phi_2, |q/p|)$ and $(\phi_2^M, \phi_2^\Gamma)$. 
To illustrate the potential reach of LHCb in $\phi_2^M$ and $\phi_2^\Gamma$ from prompt charm production at 300 fb$^{-1}$,
the projected statistical errors on $\phi$, $|q/p|$, $x$, $y$ from $D^0 \to K_s \pi^+ \pi^-$ (combined with the Belle 
error correlation matrix \cite{Peng:2014oda}), and on $\Delta Y_f = -A_\Gamma$,  
given in the last rows of Tables \ref{tab:D0KSPiPi_yields} and \ref{tab:Agamma_yields}, and assuming the central values $|q/p|=1$, $\phi=0$, $x=0.57\%$, and $y=0.7\%$, yield 
\beq \sigma (\phi_2^M ) = 2~\text{mrad},~~~ \sigma (\phi_2^\Gamma ) = 5~\text{mrad}\,.\eeq 
The projected statistical errors are  smaller for $D^0 \to K^+ \pi^-\pi^-\pi^+$ than for $D^0 \to K_s \pi^+ \pi^-$, cf. Tab.~\ref{tab:WS-D2K3pi}.
Thus, if the systematic errors are not prohibitively large, cf. Sec.~\ref{sec:expcharmmix},
LHCb could probe indirect CPV in the SM.


\subsection{Direct CP violating probes}
%Two-body hadronic $D$-meson decays can be classified
Direct \CP asymmetries,
\begin{equation}\label{ACPhh}
A_{\CP}(\Dz\to h^-h^+)\equiv \frac{\Gamma(D^0\rightarrow h^-h^+)-\Gamma(\Dzb\rightarrow h^-h^+)}{\Gamma(D^0\rightarrow h^-h^+)+\Gamma(\Dzb\rightarrow h^-h^+)},
\end{equation}
with $h$ a light meson, are suppressed in the SM but could be enhanced by NP.
%The sensitivity to direct \CP violation is enhanced through a measurement of the difference in \CP asymmetries between \Dz\to\Km\Kp and \Dz\to\pim\pip decays, $\Delta A_{\CP}=A_{\CP}(\Km\Kp)-A_{\CP}(\pim\pip)$.
%The individual asymmetries $A_{\CP}(\Km\Kp)$ and $A_{\CP}(\pim\pip)$ can also be measured. 
Quite likely the most prominent test of direct CPV in charm is the
observable 
$
\Delta A_{\CP}=A_{\CP}(\Km\Kp)-A_{\CP}(\pim\pip),
$
%(see Sec.~\ref{sec:directCP:exp} for the
%definition). 
which measure the difference between direct CPV in SCS modes $D^0 \to K^+ K^-$ and $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$. This is despite that the
SM prediction is hard to obtain.  However, assuming nominal breaking of
the $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, $\epsilon\approx f_K/f_\pi - 1 \approx
{\mathcal O}(20\,\%)$, one can infer from the observed branching ratios of the
CF decay$D^0 \to \pi^+ K^-$ and DCS decay $D^0
\to \pi^- K^+$ a consistent picture involving large
 matrix elements for $U$-spin breaking penguin~\cite{Brod:2012ud,
  Savage:1991wu, Pirtskhalava:2011va, Feldmann:2012js, Franco:2012ck,
  Hiller:2012xm}. These can account, in the presence of large strong
phases,  for values of $\Delta A_{\CP}
\lesssim 0.2\%$~\cite{Brod:2011re}, in accordance with the current
measurements. LHCb is expected to probe far into this region after
Upgrade~II (see Sec.~\ref{sec:directCP:exp}).

SCS $D$ decay modes are sensitives probes of CP violation in and
beyond the SM~\cite{Grossman:2006jg}. Other decay modes can also be
sensitive to CP asymmetries of the same order, both in the SM and in
NP extensions that modify the QCD penguin operators. Besides the modes
$D^+ \to K^+ \bar K^0$ and $D_s^+ \to \pi^+ K^0$, obtained from the
above via exchange of the spectator quark, the mode $D^0 \to K_S K_S$
is particularly interesting, because a large CP asymmetry $\lesssim
1\,\%$ can be expected~\cite{Brod:2011re, Nierste:2015zra}. The
related $D \to K K^*$ modes have smaller asymmetries, but this can be
compensated by the higher experimental
efficiency~\cite{Nierste:2017cua}.

Another interesting class of observables are the semileptonic $D$
decays, $D \to P \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $D \to P_1 P_2 \ell^+ \ell^-$,
where $P, P_1, P_2$ are light pseudoscalars. In analogy to the
well-studied corresponding semileptonic $B$ decay modes, interesting
null test of CP violation can be constructed~\cite{deBoer:2015boa,
  deBoer:2017que, deBoer:2018buv}. In certain regions of phase space,
the CP asymmetries can be largely enhanced via interferences with
resonances, which makes these decays an interesting class of
observables for LHCb.


\subsection{Null tests from isospin sum rules}
\label{sec:isospin:null:test}
SM predictions for hadronic $D$ decays are notoriously difficult. In
some cases it is possible to obtain strong indications for the
presence of NP by relating various modes using the
approximate flavor symmetry $SU(3)$ (invariance under interchange of
up, down, and strange quarks) or the more precise isospin (invariance under interchange of
up and down quarks). 

Probably the simplest example is the $D^+ \to \pi^+
\pi^0$ decay~\cite{Brod:2011re}. The final state has isospin $I=2$ which
cannot be reached from the $I = 1/2$ initial state via the $\Delta I =
1/2$ QCD penguin operators, predicting very suppressed direct CPV in the SM. An important question in this context is
the size of isospin-breaking effects. Isospin-breaking due to QED and
the difference of up- and down-quark mass is CP conserving and can be
safely neglected. The electroweak penguin contribution is relatively
suppressed by $\alpha/\alpha_s$ in the SM. Thus, enhanced direct CPV in $D^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0$ would signal the presence of
isospin-violating NP.

Another example is the sum of rate differences~\cite{Grossman:2012eb}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  |A_{\pi^+ \pi^-}|^2 - |\bar A_{\pi^+ \pi^-}|^2 & + |A_{\pi^0
    \pi^0}|^2 - |\bar A_{\pi^0 \pi^0}|^2 \\ & - \frac{3}{2} \big(
  |A_{\pi^+ \pi^0}|^2 - |\bar A_{\pi^- \pi^0}|^2 \big) = 3 \big(
  |A_{1/2}|^2 - |\bar A_{1/2}|^2 \big),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which depends only on $\Delta I = 1/2$ amplitudes. There are two
possibilities. If the sum is non-zero, there are $\Delta I = 1/2$
contributions to CP violation; they can be due to SM or NP. If the sum
is zero, but the individual asymmetries are non-zero, the CP
asymmetries are likely dominated by $\Delta I = 3/2$ NP
contributions. More sum rules, involving also vector meson final
states, can be devised for the decay modes $D \to \rho \pi$, $D \to
K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)} \pi (\rho)$, $D_s^+ \to K^* \pi
(\rho)$~\cite{Grossman:2012eb}. For an exhaustive list of sum rules
based on the flavor $SU(3)$ or its subgroups, 
%including
%also vector meson final states, 
see Refs.~\cite{Grossman:2012ry,
  Grossman:2013lya, Muller:2015rna}.

\subsection{Radiative and leptonic charm decays}
In the down-type quark sector the GIM suppression is less effective than in the up-quark sector, due to the presence of $top$-quarks running in the loops which leads to an effective decoupling with the other diagrams, owing to the large top quark mass. In the \emph{charm} sector FCNCs are instead more effectively suppressed due to the absence of a large mass down-type quark and therefore, within the SM, branching fractions of rare $D$ decays have very small values. However, these processes  can be enhanced in NP scenarios by up to several orders of magnitude when compared to the SM.  

\subsubsection{Radiative Decays}
The  $c \to u$ transition  occurs  in the SM  only at loop level, providing an option to 
study effects of NP in the up-like quark sector. 
The  GIM  mechanism leads to the  strong suppression in the 
branching ratios  of   inclusive $c\to u \gamma$. However, in the exclusive charm decays,  non-perturbative QCD effects become very important. %\section{The decay $D\to V\gamma$}
The effective weak Lagrangian for $D\to V\gamma$ is, see, e.g., \cite{deBoer:2017que},
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Leff:e1}
 \mathcal L_\text{eff}^\text{weak}=\frac{4G_F}{\sqrt 2}\left(\sum_{q\in\{d,s\}}V_{cq}^*V_{uq}\sum_{i=1}^2C_iO_i^{(q)}+\sum_{i=3}^6C_iO_i+\sum_{i=7}^8\left(C_i)_i+C_i'O_i'\right)\right)\,,

%as explained in details in Ref. \cite{deBoer:2017que}. 
The SM effective Wilson coefficients $C_i^\text{(eff)}$ are known at  two-loop level in QCD \cite{deBoer:2017que,deBoer:2016dcg,Greub:1996wn,Fajfer:2002gp}.
The authors of Ref. \cite{deBoer:2017que}  improved the SM prediction for the branching ratios of $D\to V\gamma$, by  including power corrections and updating the hybrid model predictions. The hybrid model combines   the heavy quark effective theory and chiral perturbation theory using experimentally measured parameters \cite{Fajfer:1997bh,Fajfer:1998dv}. 
They also  included corrections to the perturbative Wilson coefficients by employing  a QCD based approach, worked out for $B$ physics as reviewed in  \cite{deBoer:2017que}. Updated values for the  SM Wilson coefficients %of $Q_{1,2}$ and the effective coefficient of the chromomagnetic dipole operator
at leading order in $\alpha_s$ are given in  \cite{deBoer:2017que,deBoer:2015boa,deBoer:2016dcg}.

scenarios discussed in Ref.   \cite{deBoer:2017rzd} can contribute at the loop level to $C_{7,8}^\text{eff}$, and cannot significantly modify the branching ratios.
% making the modification of the branching ratio insignificant.
 %\td{please check the rewrite:} 
 However, the NP induced CPV asymmetry was found to still be modest, e.g.,  $\sim {\mathcal O}(10\%)$ for $D^0 \to \rho^0 \gamma$. In the case of baryonic mode $\Lambda_c \to p \gamma$ the rate is estimated to be $\sim {\cal O} (10^{-5})$. The forward-backward asymmetry of photon momentum relative to $\Lambda_c$ boost can be $0.2$ in the SM, and somewhat smaller  within scenarios of NP discussed in \cite{deBoer:2017rzd}. 
 
 
\subsubsection{Rare charm leptonic decays} 
To describe NP effects the effective Lagrangian for the $c\to u \bar \ell \ell $ has to be extended by the following operators

Among these only the $C_9$ is nonzero in the SM. For each ${\cal O}_i$ one can introduce ${\cal O}_i^\prime$ with the corresponding Wilson coefficient $C_i^\prime$ by replacing the chirality operator $P_L= 1/2(1-\gamma^5)$ by $P_R= 1/2(1+\gamma^5)$ \cite{Fajfer:2015mia}. 
%the Wilson coefficient of  operator ${\cal O}_9$ differs from 0.

 In the range of $m_c/\sqrt2\le\mu_c\le\sqrt2m_c$ the  effective Wilson coefficients  were found to be $(-0.0014-0.0054i)\le C_7\le(-0.00087-0.0033i)$ and 
 $-0.060X_{ds}(\mu_c=\sqrt2m_c)\le C_9\le0.030 X_{ds}(\mu_c=m_c/\sqrt2)$. In the small 
 $q^2 \gtrsim 1 \, \mbox{GeV}^2$ region  $|C_{9}| \lesssim 5\cdot10^{-4}$.  

One can consider contribution of this effective Lagrangian in the exclusive decay channels. For the $D$ meson di-leptonic decays the best upper bound to date is obtained by the LHCb collaboration at  the $90\%$ CL 
~\cite{Aaij:2013cza}

$BR(D^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^-) < 6.2 \times 10^{-9}$.

In the decay
$D^+ \to \pi^+ \mu^+ \mu^-$ the LHCb experiment %cused on kinematic
determined bounds on the branching ratio in the two kinematic regions of the di-lepton mass, %$q^2 = (k_- + k_+)^2$, 
 chosen to be either below or
above the dominant resonant contributions. The measured
total branching ratio, obtained by extrapolating spectra over the
non-resonant region, is~\cite{Aaij:2013sua}
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:Dpimumu-exp}
$BR(D^+ \to \pi^+ \mu^+ \mu^-) < 8.3 \ 10^{-8}$,
%\end{equation}
while the separate branching fractions in the low- and high-$q^2$ bins are bounded to be below 
$BR(\pi^+ \mu^+ \mu^-)_{I}<  2.5\times 10^{-8}$ for region I, ${q^2 \in [0.0625,0.276]\,{GeV}^2} $, and
    $BR(\pi^+ \mu^+ \mu^-)_{II}  <  2.9 \times 10^{-8}$ for region II, ${q^2 \in [1.56,4.00]{GeV}^2}$~\cite{Aaij:2013sua}.

These can be used to put bounds on Wilson coefficients. Allowing for NP contributions to only one 
 Wilson coefficient at a time gives the upper bounds listed in Table~\ref{tab:BR}, where $\tilde C_i = V_{ub} V_{cb}^* C_i$\cite{Fajfer:2015mia}.

For baryonic $c\to u \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions the relevant  form factors are known from lattice QCD calculations for the %produced relevant  for the
 $\Lambda_c \to p \ell^+\ell^-$ decay \cite{Meinel:2017ggx}. The dominant contributions to the branching ratio come from resonant regions of $\Lambda_c  \to p \rho, (\omega, \phi)$ with $\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ decaying to $\mu^+ \mu^-$. %\td{not sure about the meaning of this sentence.

 The upper 90\% CL bound $BR(\Lambda_c \to p  \mu^+ \mu^-)_{exp}  <7.7 \times 10^{-8}$  \cite{Aaij:2017nsd}, obtained by excluding the $\pm40$ MeV intervals around resonances still allows NP contribution in $C_9$ and $ C_{10}$. 
The $\Lambda_c \to p \mu^+ \mu^-$ forward-backward asymmetry appears as a result of  a nonzero $C_{10}$ Wilson coefficient, generated by the NP.  Therefore  this observable  provides a clean null test of the SM as suggested in Ref. \cite{Meinel:2017ggx}.%The case of

defined close to the $\phi$  resonance that couples to the lepton pair and they  can be generated by imaginary parts of the $C_{7}$ Wilson coefficients in the effective Lagrangian  for $c \to  u l^+l^−$ processes. 
In the case of any NP scenario one cannot consider any charm rare decays without considering bounds from the $D^0- \bar D^0 $ oscillation as pointed out in \cite{Golowich:2009ii}. In some particular NP scenarios, bounds on NP are stronger if from  the $D^0- \bar D^0 $ oscillation. 
 In addition, if the NP is realized by the left-handed doublets of the weak isospin, then NP present in $B$ physics also inevitably appears in charm physics, accompanied with the appropriate CKM matrix elements.  



\subsection{Inputs for $B$ physics}
If discovered, the presence of direct CP violation in $D$ decays can
affect the extraction of the CKM angle $\gamma$ from the
``tree-level'' decays $B \to DK$~\cite{Gronau:1990ra, Gronau:1991dp,
  Atwood:1996ci, Giri:2003ty}. If one includes the $B \to D \pi$
modes, the effect can be of order one~\cite{Martone:2012nj}. One of
the advantages of obtaining $\gamma$ from tree decays is that all
hadronic parameters can be fit from data. This remains essentially
true even if direct CPV is present in the decays of the final-state
$D$ mesons~\cite{Martone:2012nj, Wang:2012ie, Bhattacharya:2013vc}, as
long as one includes all direct CP asymmetries in the fit -- there are
still more observables than parameters in the fit. However, one can
show that there remains an ambiguity: A shift in the angle $\gamma$
can be compensated by a corresponding, unobservable shift in the
contributing strong phases. This shift symmetry can be broken by
assuming the absence of CPV in one of the $D$ decay modes (for
instance, in the SM this is the case for CF and DCS decay
modes). Alternatively, one could consider ratios of $B \to f_D K$ and
$B \to f_D \pi$ modes where the strong phase
cancels~\cite{LHCb-CONF-2012-032}, or use information on the relative
strong phases, e.g., by measuring entangled decays at $D$
factories~\cite{Martone:2012nj}.
